So there I was, sitting in a meeting at [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) (I'm a software engineer at a company you've heard of), trying to explain to our team why we need to build a "one-stop-shop" interface for all our scattered domain knowledge. You know the drill. Some data in PaaS databases in Azure, some in SharePoint sites (because of course), some in Git repos, and some OneDrive folders. We want 1 interface that our users can go to and ask questions and also take some actions. The one stop shop. Not just a chatbot, but doing it all.

"We need something that not only answers questions but also takes actions," I said, feeling pretty confident. Then someone asked, "Should we use RAG or MCP for this?"

And that's when I realized... I had no idea if these were competing technologies, complementary ones, or if one was just a subset of the other. Wait are they the same thing? Does one use the other? Is RAG just a subset of MCP? Are there platforms and tools that just use both? Would you even do that? Which is more cost efficient? Which is more effective for context windows? Wait what does any of this mean? We just want a 1 stop shop chatbot interface that can get all of our knowledge and take actions. So MCP or RAG? or both? Or how does any of this work?

**Spoiler alert**: They're not competing. At all. But let me tell you how I figured that out.

*Me trying to understand if RAG and MCP are the same thing*

## The Speed of AI Development Is Overwhelming (And That's Okay)

Look, even I'm struggling to keep up with the pace of AI announcements. Things are moving so fast with AI right now it's overwhelming. Every day there's new announcements, just reading through the [2025 Microsoft Build Book of news](https://news.microsoft.com/build-2025-book-of-news/) and the [2025 Google I/O](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2025-collection/) book of news and all the various [VS Code announcements on the VS Code blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/vscode-blog) is so overwhelming it's confusing.

It's like trying to drink from a fire hose while someone keeps increasing the water pressure. And if you're feeling overwhelmed by all the acronyms and announcements, you're not alone. That's exactly why I'm writing this. To bring some clarity to at least two pieces of this puzzle: MCP and RAG.

The world of AI is moving so fast, so many of us are behind. This is not the time for writers to show how smart they are and be snobby. I'm not here to arrogantly act like some sort of expert and throw around big words and acronyms to confuse you. My brand is I take very complex things and explain them in a way that's super approachable. This article is doing exactly that for a technical audience that may feel overwhelmed by the speed of AI development and all that's available right now. Say things in the most bare bones, plain, approachable way you can. Assume nothing.

## Setting the Scene: Our Actual Problem

Before we get to the front end side of this where we either have a chatbot or leverage some existing platform and just plug our thing in, we want to build the capabilities behind the scenes that enable this. I am trying to understand all this myself so I can effectively guide our intern, who gets the very cool job of working on this primarily without having to handle all the other enterprise cruft and stuff (that's the job though) this summer.

Before we dive into the technical stuff, let me paint you a picture of what we're dealing with. We've got:

- **Domain knowledge** scattered across a dozen different systems
- **Users** who just want answers without playing digital hide and seek
- **An intern** who gets the cool job of building this (while I handle all the enterprise cruft, that's the job though)
- **A vision** for something that's not just another chatbot, but a system that can actually *do things*

Now, the question is: MCP or RAG? Or both? Or... wait, what do these even mean? We need clarity!

## RAG: The Information Gatherer

Let's start with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Think of RAG like having a really smart research assistant who:

1. **Listens to your question**
2. **Runs to the library** (your knowledge bases)
3. **Grabs relevant books** (documents/data)
4. **Comes back and synthesizes an answer**

Here's how it actually works:

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>The RAG Pipeline (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

1. **Query Processing**: Your question gets analyzed to figure out what information is needed
2. **Retrieval**: The system fetches relevant documents from your databases/knowledge bases
3. **Augmented Generation**: The LLM generates a response using both its training AND the retrieved info

</details>

### Real Example from Our Work Scenario

User asks: *"What's our policy on remote work requests?"*

**Without RAG**: The LLM might give you some generic answer based on what it learned from training data, probably from 2023 or whenever it was trained.

**With RAG**:

1. System searches through our SharePoint policy documents and finds the current remote work policy
2. LLM generates: "According to our updated policy from March 2025, remote work requests need manager approval and should be submitted through the HR portal at least 2 weeks in advance."

Alright, so is this a key difference? RAG is adding to the context window, but MCP is not? So with a MCP approach to adding context, the context window is not impacted, or it's just impacted less? This needs to be super clear, to both me and the developer community trying to make sense of all this.

Knowing the difference between RAG and MCP will be key going forward. It seems RAG gets information before generating a response, MCP is doing that during the generation process, but I'd imagine the differences go even beyond that.

> **Important:** RAG enhances accuracy, reduces hallucinations, provides customizable knowledge from domain-specific sources, and offers transparency through citations. It's particularly good for enterprise AI search scenarios.

## MCP: The Action Hero (And Universal Connector)

Now, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is different. Instead of gathering all the info upfront, MCP lets the AI say, "Hey, I need something" *during* the conversation. But here's the key thing I learned from diving deeper: **MCP is really about standardization**.

Think of MCP like USB-C for AI systems. Before USB-C, every device had its own proprietary connector. Now we have one universal standard. MCP does the same thing for AI -- it standardizes how LLMs connect to external tools, APIs, and data sources.

MCP is like having an assistant who can:

1. **Start answering your question**
2. **Realize they need more info**
3. **Make a standardized request to get it** (not custom code for each system)
4. **Continue the conversation**

MCP provides a standardized way for LLMs to:

- Request additional information on-demand
- Perform actions in external systems
- Not blow up the context window with everything upfront
- Connect to tools using a universal protocol instead of custom integrations

### Same Work Example, MCP Style

User asks: *"What's our policy on remote work requests?"*

With MCP:

1. Model recognizes it needs to check current policies
2. Outputs a structured request: `{action: "search_hr_policies", query: "remote work", department: "current_user_dept"}`
3. HR system processes the request and returns current policy data
4. Model incorporates it into the response AND offers: "Would you like me to start a remote work request for you?"

> **Important:** MCP optimizes context usage, provides structured information using schemas, creates information hierarchy, ensures consistency, and improves performance. It's especially valuable for agentic AI use cases where you need to take actions.
{: .notice--primary}

## The Key Differences (Finally!)

**Notice:** This is the part where everything clicks together. Pay attention!
{: .notice--warning}

Here's what I've figured out after reading way too many articles and having several "aha!" moments:

| Aspect | RAG | MCP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **When it acts** | Before generation (preprocessing) | During generation (on-demand) |
| **Context window impact** | Fills it up with retrieved docs | Minimal -- only gets what's needed |
| **Best for** | Knowledge retrieval, Q&A | Actions, tool use, dynamic tasks |
| **Implementation complexity** | Relatively straightforward | More complex, needs protocol handling |

**The big revelation**: They're not mutually exclusive! You can (and probably should) use both. In fact, one of the coolest things I learned is that **RAG can actually be implemented as an MCP tool**. So instead of thinking "MCP vs RAG," think "MCP + RAG."

## Not MCP vs RAG -- It's MCP + RAG

Remember our one-stop-shop interface dream? Here's what I'm thinking after doing this research:

- **Use RAG for**: Answering questions about our domain knowledge across SharePoint, databases, etc. ("What's our current policy on X?")
- **Use MCP for**: Taking actions like creating tickets, updating records, sending notifications ("Create a high-priority ticket for engineering")  
- **Use MCP + RAG together**: Complex workflows where you need both knowledge retrieval AND actions ("Find all customers affected by issue X and send them an email")

The beautiful thing? With MCP's standardization approach, we could have multiple RAG systems as MCP tools, each specialized for different knowledge domains. One MCP tool for our policy documents, another for customer data, another for technical documentation -- all accessible through the same standardized interface.

It's not MCP *or* RAG -- it's MCP *and* RAG, each doing what they do best. And here's something that blew my mind: you can actually have RAG functionality running *as an MCP tool*. So your AI system could use MCP to connect to a RAG pipeline when it needs to retrieve knowledge, and use other MCP tools when it needs to take actions.

> **Put simply**: RAG is best suited for enterprise AI search while MCP should support agentic AI use cases. But the real power comes from combining them in a standardized way.

## An Aside: Microsoft Still Can't Name Things

Another thing I want to talk about and bring clarity to is understanding for those building on Azure (which is many thousands if not millions of developers worldwide that Microsoft has their company locked into 365 and Azure and it's not at all easy to shift clouds, multi cloud my behind, you know how much work that is??) about understanding all these names. I read [this article](https://medium.com/@speaktoharisudhan/azure-open-ai-vs-azure-ai-services-vs-azure-ai-foundry-c45e4a7d5013) trying to understand it all, and honestly? Microsoft can't name things man.

You've got:

- **Azure AI** (the umbrella term)
- **Azure OpenAI** (OpenAI models on Azure)
- **Azure OpenAI Service** (wait, isn't that the same thing?)
- **Azure AI Services** (formerly Cognitive Services)
- **Azure AI Foundry** (formerly AI Studio, formerly AI Hub)
- **Azure AI Search** (vector search for your RAG needs)
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** (for building copilots)
- **Azure Machine Learning** (the OG platform)

It is confusing, [no be small](http://naijalingo.com/words/no-be-small-thing-o).

*Trying to explain Azure AI product names to literally anyone*

### The Quick Decoder Ring

<details markdown="1">
<summary><strong>Azure AI Products Explained (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

- **[Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/what-is-ai-studio)**: The new unified platform for building AI apps. Think of it as your AI development hub. (This week's name, anyway)
- **[Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service)**: GPT-4, DALL-E, etc. on Azure infrastructure
- **[Azure AI Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services)**: Pre-built AI models (vision, speech, language, etc.)
- **[Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search)**: Vector search that powers your RAG implementations
- **[Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning)**: For when you need to train custom models

</details>

Look, I genuinely like working here, but someone needs to have a serious conversation with whoever's in charge of naming things. It's like they're playing acronym bingo while blindfolded.

### Consider Their Gaming Console History

My point is Microsoft's naming skills are [mid](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mid) at best. Consider their gaming console progressions over the years:

1. Xbox ([2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)))
2. Xbox 360 ([2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360))
3. Xbox One ([2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One))
4. Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S ([2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S))

Now consider how Sony, creators of the PlayStation, have named their gaming consoles:

1. PlayStation ([1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)))
2. PlayStation 2 ([2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2))
3. PlayStation 3 ([2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3))
4. PlayStation 4 ([2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4))
5. PlayStation 5 ([2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5))

I hope my point is clear: there's beauty in simplicity. Do you know how many parents bought their kids the wrong Xbox because they couldn't decipher Microsoft's convoluted naming scheme? It is confusing, [no be small](http://naijalingo.com/words/no-be-small-thing-o).

## Practical Next Steps

Alright, so where do we go from here? If you're in a similar boat (trying to make sense of all this while building something real), here's my advice:

1. **Start with your use case**: Do you need information retrieval, action-taking, or both?
2. **Prototype with RAG first**: It's easier to implement and understand
3. **Add MCP when you need actions**: Don't overcomplicate things upfront
4. **Pick your tools**:
   - For RAG: [LangChain](https://langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://llamaindex.ai/), or [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search)
   - For MCP: [Anthropic's MCP SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol)

**Notice:** For enterprise versus open source solutions, most platforms now support both RAG and MCP approaches. Azure AI Foundry (yes, that's what we're calling it this week) provides both capabilities in a single platform.

## Cost and Efficiency Considerations

Since you're probably wondering about the practical stuff:

**Cost-wise**: RAG typically has higher upfront costs because you're stuffing those context windows with retrieved documents. MCP can be more efficient for selective information retrieval since it only grabs what it actually needs. But honestly? The "which is more cost-effective" question depends entirely on your use case and how much data you're dealing with.

**Context window impact**: This is where MCP really shines. Instead of cramming everything into the context window upfront (the RAG approach), MCP only pulls what's needed when it's needed. It's like the difference between carrying everything you might need in a giant backpack versus having a phone to call for specific things.

**Which is more effective**: So you can use both of them? That needs to be super clear. When would you use one versus the other? What would be a case and some situations where you'd use both? Which is more efficient cost wise? What are the leading platforms for building RAG and MCP or is there a leading solution for enterprise versus open source? Why not both? Seriously, the most effective solutions I've seen combine both approaches. Use RAG for broad knowledge access and MCP for specific tool use and dynamic information retrieval.

## Closing Thoughts

Look, the pace of AI development is absolutely bonkers right now. Every day there's a new announcement, a new acronym, a new "game-changing" technology. It's overwhelming, and that's okay.

What matters is understanding the fundamentals:

- **RAG** = Get information before answering
- **MCP** = Get information or take actions during the conversation
- **Both** = A powerful combination for real-world applications

As for our project? We're going with both. Our intern is going to build a RAG pipeline for knowledge retrieval and implement MCP for action-taking. Will it work perfectly? Probably not at first. But that's how we learn.

And Microsoft? Please. For the love of all that is holy. Hire someone who can name things consistently. My sanity (and that of thousands of developers worldwide locked into your ecosystem) depends on it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go explain to someone why Azure AI Foundry isn't the same as Azure AI Services but somehow includes Azure AI Services and... you know what? I need coffee.
