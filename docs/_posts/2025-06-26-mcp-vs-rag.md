## TL;DR

![Obi-Wan](/assets/images/obiwan.gif)

Hello and welcome! To save you time:

**Agentic AI**: AI systems that can take actions and make decisions autonomously, not just answer questions. Think of AI that can book flights, schedule appointments, post on TikTok, send emails, or update databases (_shudders_) on its own. You know, just the stuff that usually brings about the [end of the world](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/24/1113647/why-handing-over-total-control-to-ai-agents-would-be-a-huge-mistake/) in [science fiction movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover_in_popular_culture).

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Searches through knowledge sources and adds relevant info to the AI's context before it responds. Think of it as giving the AI a research assistant. Invented by [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-streamlining-the-creation-of-intelligent-natural-language-processing-models/).

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A standardized way for AI to connect to tools and data sources during conversations. Like ChatGPT being able to look at your investment account in real time when you ask it "how am I doing financially?" This is the foundational tech behind Agentic AI systems. Invented by [Anthropic](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

**Their Relationship**: They're not competing technologies. RAG is about retrieving information, MCP is about standardizing connections. You can even implement RAG as an MCP tool. Use RAG when you need knowledge retrieval, MCP when you need actions or dynamic data access, and both for complex AI agents.

Hopefully that answers the question that brought you to this article. You could leave now, but if you keep reading, there's memes and fun ahead. I shall now enter "_this is a a personal blog in some backwater corner of the internet, so I'm going to yap as much as I want, lol what are you going to do about it?_" mode.

## Some Background

To set the stage, I'm a software engineer at a [company you've probably heard of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) that's getting AI this and AI that [falcon punched](https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+Captain+Falcon+Falcon+Punch) into my face every day. Whether in Teams chats, emails, meetings, tech blogs, tech forums, at church, at the barbershop, talking to friends and family, on dates (not even kidding), I can't escape AI. It's [everything, everywhere, all at once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once). Which, to be fair, I'm not particularly mad about. I'm fascinated by AI and have grown to love working with it. It's just that the sheer volume of its reach can be overwhelming.

At work and in my [personal projects](https://github.com/segunak), my particular brand of AI exposure is more on the builder side of things. That is, a group of people taking [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) and extending them, building things that use AI to enhance whatever areas they're working in.

This is different than what [Machine Learning Engineers](https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+a+Machine+Learning+Engineer) do. They're the people creating and enhancing models like [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-research/), [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/), [GPT-4.1,](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/) [GPT-4.1-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.1-mini), [GPT-4.5](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-4-5/), [o1](https://openai.com/o1/), [o3](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/), [o4-mini](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/), [o4-mini-high](https://www.google.com/search?q=What+is+OpenAI+GPT+o4-mini-high), (OpenAI's abysmal naming conventions are almost certainly a byproduct of their [close relationship with Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/01/21/microsoft-and-openai-evolve-partnership-to-drive-the-next-phase-of-ai/), who infamously [struggle to name products clearly](https://www.google.com/search?q=Why+does+Microsoft+suck+at+naming+things)), [Claude Opus 4](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4), [Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4), [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-pro), [Llama 4](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/), and whatever [Mistral is calling their latest model](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/).

Think of it this way: we're both athletes, but in different sports. Maybe Machine Learning Engineers are playing baseball while we're playing basketball. Both benefit from being athletic (technical skills), but they're different sports requiring different tactics. Or maybe it's more like chess vs. checkers. I don't know, no analogy is perfect. The point is, they're building the models, and we're taking those models and building with them.

Some terms used to describe people extending (rather than building from scratch) AI models are [AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer) (the emerging standard) and AI Builder (more ambiguous because Microsoft [went and named a product this exact thing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ai-builder/overview)). Or maybe we'll end up calling them _[Agent Bosses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/how-to-be-an-agent-boss)_ if the marketing teams get their way ðŸ™„. This includes software engineers, product managers, and business analysts who build custom AI features for specific use cases. Like banks adding AI chatbots or Instagram integrating Meta AI into search.

## Diving Deep

This is the part of the article where I assume you're as inundated with AI stuff as I am. Particularly from the perspective of an AI Engineer/Builder, as that's usually the kind of person looking for answers about MCP vs RAG. Someone asked me that exact question not more than a [fortnight](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+fortnight) ago, to which my initial reaction was:

![Confused Math Lady Meme](/assets/images/confused-math-lady-meme.gif)

Which led me to almost saying "why don't you ask ChatGPT?", an intuition I didn't act on, and am somewhat ashamed to admit I felt. It's the modern version of [Let Me Google That For You](https://letmegooglethat.com/). I don't think it's wrong to use AI to help you understand AI, I do it all the time. But this person came to me, a human, hoping for an approachable explanation that would set them in the right direction. It's kind of messed up to respond by going "ask AI", so I set out to better understand how MCP and RAG fit together.

I realized, despite having read the literature surrounding them, that I had no idea if they were competing, working together, talking, dating, [situationship](https://www.google.com/search?q=situationship), [entanglement](https://www.google.com/search?q=entanglement+jada+pinkett), married, or something in between. Are they competing technologies? Complementary ones? Or is one just a subset of the other? Which is more cost efficient? Which should I start with if I'm trying to add AI to a project?

Let's explore.

## What Is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** adds a search step to any language model workflow. It's like having a research assistant who:

1. Listens to your question
2. Grabs relevant documents from your knowledge bases
3. Feeds them to the AI along with your question
4. AI generates an answer using both its training and the retrieved info

**Example**: You ask "What's our remote work policy?" RAG searches your SharePoint documents, finds the current policy, and the AI responds with accurate, up-to-date information instead of generic advice.

**Key point**: RAG happens *before* the AI generates its response. Everything gets loaded into the context window (the amount of information a LLM can process at once) upfront.

## What Is MCP?

If you read the many dozens of MCP articles online, they'll say **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is like USB-C for AI systems. Which is true in a sense, but there's no perfect analogies, so here's another one.

MCP is like having a personal assistant who can call anyone, order DoorDash, book an Uber, schedule your Real ID appointment (what a miracle that would be), make dinner reservations, update your Instagram bio, or post on TikTok. All the things, they can just go and do them. Think of how life is for high-profile celebrities. Do you think Tom Cruise schedules his own dinner appointments? His dry cleaning? Nah. Somebody does that.

If you read the many dozens of MCP articles online, they'll say **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is like USB-C for AI systems. Which is true in a sense, but there's no perfect analogies, so here's a more human one. It's like having a personal assistant who can call anyone, make orders on DoorDash, order you an Uber, schedule your Real ID appointment (what a miracle that would be), make dinner reservations for you, update your Instagram bio, make a post for you onTikTok, all the things, it can just go and do them. Think of how life is for high profile celebrites. Do you think Tom Cruise, the greatest action movie superstar in human history (his scientilogy weridness ain't got nothintgto do with me don't @ me) schedules his own dinner appointemnts? His dry cleaning? Nah. Somebody does that .We have developed technolgoy with AI, an MCP server, that can take 1 AI sysmte, your chatbot like ChatGPT or Claude or GEmini or the Chatbot that your company has or the chatbot you decide to make for oyur own website and connect it to wherere to not just get information like RAG (MCP can use RAG, that's key to understand, it can be a part of it) but als odo stuff and thagns. 

It's like having a personal assistant who can call any department in your company when they need something.

But here's what makes MCP different: your assistant doesn't gather everything and research through it first. They just say "I know exactly who has this answer, let me call them right quick" and get you what you need. MCP goes straight to the specific source that has the answer, not searching through everything to find it.

Instead of gathering all the info upfront, MCP lets the AI request information or take actions *during* the conversation using a standardized protocol.

Think of MCP as giving your AI the ability to:































1. Start answering your question
2. Realize it needs more info or needs to do something
3. Make a structured request using standardized methods
4. Continue the conversation with the new info or after taking the action

**Same example**: You ask "What's our remote work policy?" The AI realizes it needs current policy info, makes an MCP request to the HR system, gets the data, and responds. But it can also ask: "Would you like me to start a remote work request for you?"

**Key point**: MCP happens *during* the conversation. It's about standardized connections to tools and data sources, not just information retrieval.

## The Key Differences

| Aspect | RAG | MCP |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **When it acts** | Before generation | During generation |
| **Context window** | Fills it up with retrieved docs | Only gets what's needed |
| **Best for** | Knowledge retrieval, Q&A | Actions, tools, dynamic tasks |
| **Standardization** | Implementation-specific | Universal protocol |

**The big revelation**: They're not mutually exclusive! You can use both. RAG can actually be implemented as an MCP tool.

## Using Both Together

For our work scenario (scattered knowledge across SharePoint, databases, Git repos):

- **Use RAG for**: Answering questions about domain knowledge
- **Use MCP for**: Taking actions like creating tickets, sending emails, updating records  
- **Use both together**: Complex workflows that need knowledge retrieval AND actions

The beauty of MCP's standardization is you can have multiple RAG systems as MCP tools, each specialized for different knowledge domains.

## Practical Considerations

**Cost**: RAG has higher upfront costs (stuffing context windows with documents). MCP can be more efficient since it only grabs what's needed when needed.

**Context windows**: MCP shines here. Instead of cramming everything in upfront, it pulls information on-demand.

**Which to choose**: Start with your use case. If you need information retrieval, go with RAG. If you need actions, go with MCP. If you need both, use both.

## Bottom Line

- **RAG** = Get information before answering
- **MCP** = Get information or take actions during the conversation  
- **Both** = The most powerful approach for real-world applications

The pace of AI development is wild right now, but understanding these fundamentals will help you make better decisions about which tools to use for your specific use case.
