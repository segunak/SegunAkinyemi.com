## Some Background

We're back with another entry in my series of [STEM Workshops](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#stem-workshops), where I share content I've created to teach the fundamentals of computer science, software engineering, and technology to persons of varying backgrounds. This particular workshop is focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is the hottest topic in technology‚Äîand maybe the entire world‚Äîright now. While it might seem magical, the fundamental aspects behind it are rooted in math, probability, and statistics, just at massively refined scales. This workshop aims to take the foundational ideas of AI and distill them into something people can understand, regardless of their technical background.

To do this, it simplifies those concepts quite drastically as they relate to popular AI tools like ChatGPT. I strive to maintain accuracy, but it's undeniable that the concepts are far more complex than how they're presented in the workshop. However, the basic idea is there. I take inspiration for this teaching approach from one of my favorite YouTube channels, [OverSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/@OverSimplified). It breaks down complex historical topics into simple ideas that anyone can understand. The creator doesn't shy away from saying, "Yes, this is oversimplified," but that's the point: make the ideas accessible, spark curiosity, and give people enough understanding to dive deeper on their own.

That's the theme of this workshop. It's an intentionally oversimplified dive into the foundations behind Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning‚Äîthe pillars of AI.

From middle school students just getting started to college learners with coding experience, this workshop is designed to meet students where they are. For tech and AI experts reviewing this material‚Äîdon't worry, I know these concepts are more complex than what's presented here, and that's okay. This is a one-hour opportunity to introduce key ideas and provide a conceptual framework for understanding how AI actually works.  

For professionals, the workshop adapts to focus on AI's real-world applications, encouraging discussion and engagement. Those intrigued by what they learn‚Äîwhether students or professionals‚Äîwill hopefully take the next steps to explore further, perhaps by leveraging online resources like those cataloged [here](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-learning-resources/).  

## Workshop Overview

The workshop breaks down the concepts of AI into digestible sections, followed by hands-on coding activities that progressively build from random word generation to interactive AI text prediction.

- **Duration:** ~1 hour  
  - **Student Version:** 30 minutes of presentation, activity, and discussion, followed by a 30-minute coding exercise.  
  - **Professional Version:** 30 minutes of presentation and interactive discussion, followed by a 30-minute audience engagement activity.  

- **Audience:**  
  - **Student Version:** Middle school, high school, and college students, from no technical background to those with some programming experience.  
  - **Professional Version:** Industry professionals with varying levels of technical expertise, from minimal to advanced.  

- **Goal:** Participants will gain a foundational understanding of how AI systems like ChatGPT work, including key concepts in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning.  
  - **Student Version:** Emphasizes hands-on coding to reinforce AI concepts.  
  - **Professional Version:** Focuses on real-world applications of AI in industry through discussion and interactive exercises.

## Required Expertise

For participants, no technical background is required. Those with some coding experience will find the later activities more familiar, but the workshop is designed to be accessible to anyone with curiosity and a willingness to learn. That said, facilitators will benefit greatly from a solid understanding of these concepts‚Äîit's challenging to stand before a room of curious people, ready to poke, prod, and ask questions, without a firm grasp of the material. The [facilitation resources](#facilitation-resources) are designed to help with building that understanding.

## Required Materials

- The [facilitation resources](#facilitation-resources).
- Pen and paper for all participants.
- Laptops with internet access if doing the AI training portion (one per person or group of 3‚Äì4 people works best).
- A Microsoft account logged in on the laptops to access the [Visual Studio Code for Education](https://vscodeedu.com) project found [here](https://vscodeedu.com/Q4eHFHOieGscZpldANxN).

## Workshop Structure

Here's the overall structure of this workshop.

### Activity 1: Exploring AI Training Concepts

Participants begin by exploring the difference between traditional programming ("writing rules") and AI ("learning patterns"). Through an interactive pen-and-paper exercise, they create pseudocode representing potential AI training systems, gaining insight into how AI learns from labeled data (supervised learning) and raw text data (self-supervised learning). This foundational activity sets the stage for understanding how AI models like ChatGPT are trained.

### Activity 2: Hands-On AI Training

This section is included in the student version of the workshop. The professional version replaces it with additional content in Activity 1 and extra slides exploring how participants engage with AI in their industry.

In the student version, using Python files from the [Visual Studio Code for Education project](https://vscodeedu.com/Q4eHFHOieGscZpldANxN), students will:

1. Run a basic random word generator.
2. Improve it using [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (a way to predict the next word based on previous ones) and tweakable parameters like `window_size` (how many previous words are considered) and `temperature` (how random or creative the word selection is).
3. Interact with an AI-like model they refine themselves, experiencing firsthand how adjustments impact output.
