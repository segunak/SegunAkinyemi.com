## Introduction

I recently finished an anime called [*Legend of the Galactic Heroes*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu){:target="_blank"} that I found to be of immense quality. In my opinion, it's worthy of far more attention than it generally receives in the contemporary [anime](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-anime-definition-examples/){:target="_blank"} community. The number one complaint among those who've watched — or attempted watching — *Legend of the Galactic Heroes* is that it's "boring". The show distinctly lacks many of the standard [anime tropes](https://www.cbr.com/common-anime-tropes-everywhere/){:target="_blank"} renown for their ability to keep the constant attention of an ever-growing, but often restless, audience.

*Legend of the Galactic Heroes* focuses on an interstellar conflict between groups of completely normal human beings. It explores themes like heroism, populism, social hierarchies, the tragedy of war, human nature, leadership styles, the morality of various systems of government, and much much more. I won't spoil any major plot details, but one of the main characters is a military officer named Yang Wen-li. Yang is known across the galaxy for his incredible wisdom and genius battle tactics that — coupled with his easygoing and humble disposition — make him a true stand out among men of war.

In the anime, Yang becomes the mentor of an early career officer named Julian. Julian grows to deeply admire Yang, so much so that he devotes himself to meticulously chronicling the sayings, exploits, and all-around legend of "The Great Yang Wen-li". Julian's dedication to Yang earned him no small measure of ridicule from his peers, many of whom found his fandom to be unbecoming. They thought Julian a man lacking in personal ambition, pride, and desire for the shadow of a great name entirely of his own making. Julian however paid them no mind. He believed Yang to be a once-in-a-generation sort of leader, the kind whom people, both present and future, could stand to learn from. With this belief, Julian's ambition was not to become great in his own right. Instead, he aimed to ensure that humanity would have an accurate record of a man he knew to be greater than himself.

So what does any of that have to do with the *Commands of Christ*? Well, I imagine the apostles felt much like Julian in their quests to chronicle the life and words of Jesus Christ, whom they regarded as both mentor and Lord. As a follower of Christ myself, I felt inspired by Julian's example in *Legend of the Galactic Heroes* to try my hand at compiling some of Christ's most important words. Namely, his commands. In Jesus's own words.

> But why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do the things which I say?
>
> <cite>[Luke 6:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke6:46&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

And:

> If you love Me, keep My commandments.
>
> <cite>[John 14:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A15&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

The question then becomes, what are the commandments of Jesus Christ?

## The Commands of Christ

The quotes below are a list of commands issued by Jesus Christ throughout the Bible. They were compiled using various Christian resources found online, some of which were already existing lists on the same topic. You can view a list of resources used in this work by visiting the [resources](#resources) section.

The commands are taken primarily from the [New King James Version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_King_James_Version){:target="_blank"} of the Bible. No guarantees on this list being exhaustive, as its compilation was the work of but one man. The task of determining if a given Jesus quote qualifies as a long-lived "command" is oftentimes subjective, in that the personal judgment of the preparer must be used. By compiling this list from several sources, I hope to have weeded out any personal bias about what constitutes a command of Christ.

If there's a command you were expecting to see but didn't; or one you see below that you don't think is a true command, feel free to let me know in the comment section below, or via my [contact page](/contact){:target="_blank"}. I'd be more than happy to update the list!

### Matthew

> From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

> <cite>[Matthew 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew4:17&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Then He said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
>
> <cite>[Matthew 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew4:19&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great <i>is</i> your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:11-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:11-12&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:16&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches <i>them,</i> he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:17-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:17-19&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:23-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:23-25&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast <i>it</i> from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast <i>it</i> from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:27-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:27-30&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.' But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:33-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:33-37&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have <i>your</i> cloak also. And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:38-42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:38-42&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more <i>than others?</i> Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 5:44-48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew5:44-48&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>

> Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:1-4&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:5-8&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> In this manner, therefore, pray: "Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done. On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen."
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:9-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:9-13&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:14-15&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:16-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:16-18&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:19-21&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:25-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:25-26&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 6:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew6:33&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:1-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:1-3&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:6&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:7-8&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:12&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Enter by the narrow gate; for wide <i>is</i> the gate and broad <i>is</i> the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow <i>is</i> the gate and difficult <i>is</i> the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:13-14&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
>
> <cite>[Matthew 7:15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew7:15-16&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
>
> <cite>[Matthew 8:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew8:22&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest truly <i>is</i> plentiful, but the laborers <i>are</i> few. Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest."
>
> <cite>[Matthew 9:37-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew9:37-38&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 10:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew10:16&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
>
> <cite>[Matthew 10:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew10:28&version=NKJV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.

> Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!

> <cite>[Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew11:28-30&version=NIV){:target="_blank"}</cite>


> He answered and said to them: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one. The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness, and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!".

> How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread?—<i>but</i> to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then they understood that He did not tell <i>them</i> to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

> Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.' And if he refuses to hear them, tell <i>it</i> to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.

> Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business. When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers' money and overturned the tables. And He said to those who sold doves, "Take these things away! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise!".

The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit".
