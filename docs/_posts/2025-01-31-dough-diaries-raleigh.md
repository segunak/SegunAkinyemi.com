## We're Back

Here we are again with another installment in my [Dough Diaries](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#dough-diaries) series, where I discuss my passion for cinnamon rolls in ways bordering on obsessive. If you've seen my [Jefferson City, Missouri](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/dough-diaries-jefferson-city/) edition, you know the drill: I love cinnamon rolls and consider them to be **the** apex pastry. That is not an overstatement. I speak without hyperbole. I [stand on business](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stand+on+business). If you disagree...

</div>

Nah, just joking, it's okay. I respect your right to be wrong. That's the foundation of an intellectually honest societyâ€”one where we gather, exchange ideas, debate opinions, and engage with even the most catastrophically misguided perspectives, all while hoping reason prevails and the wayward eventually find their way to the truth. So, it's fine if you disagree with my _unyieldingly dogmatic_ stance on cinnamon rolls. It is, after all, [the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+mark+of+an+educated+mind+to+be+able+to+entertain+a+thought+without+accepting+it). I do hope though that you'll one day see the light. Probably after a bite of the perfect cinnamon roll, which might just be found in Raleigh, North Carolina.

## Some Background

Since this is my first post of 2025, before diving into my pastry-related thoughts, let me set the stage by sharing how I closed out 2024â€”on an adventure through Raleigh, North Carolina. I spent the holidays there, visiting family and friends, exploring the city, checking out various [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)â€”and most notably, perusing its cinnamon roll scene.

Let me just say: Raleigh is a fantastic place. Between Raleigh proper, Cary, Durham, and Chapel Hill, there's so much to do and see, especially if your idea of fun doesn't revolve around the clubbing/nightlife vibe you'd find in cities like Atlanta, Houston, or Los Angeles. Raleigh feels like a big small town. The downtown area is compactâ€”smaller even than Charlotte'sâ€”but downtown isn't what makes Raleigh shine. What's special are the surrounding neighborhoods, each with its own charm and attractions. The city also benefits from the presence of major (and [academically prestigious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ivy)) universities like Duke, NC State, UNC Chapel Hill, and Wake Forest, which bring both youthful energy and economic opportunity to the region. That's why companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft have set up shop in Raleigh, tapping into the talent pool through partnerships with [Research Triangle Park](https://www.rtp.org/).  

Now, of everything I explored, the standout by far was NC State's [James B. Hunt Jr. Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/faYL3Bharp2UkGgz7). As someone who loves libraries, visits them often, and tries to avoid sensationalism, I say this without hesitation: it's one of the best modern libraries I've ever seen. A pristine, contemporary aesthetic that's far from genericâ€”spacious and airy, with a rooftop patio overlooking a lake, countless cozy nooks to settle into, and, because this is NC State, an engineering marvel in the form of their [bookBot](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/hunt/bookbot)â€”a robotic retrieval system that feels straight out of a sci-fi movie. Most importantly, it's free and open to the public. If you ever find yourself in Raleigh, alongside hunting for cinnamon rolls (which we're about to get into), make sure you visit Hunt Library. It's absolutely worth it.

Now, let's talk about Raleigh's cinnamon roll scene.

## The Top Three

If you're partial to short reads, you can stop here. I get itâ€”I'm no stranger to verbosity, and our attention spans as a society are [undoubtedly shrinking under the influence of social media](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385214649_This_is_Your_Brain_on_Social_Media_How_Social_Media_Use_is_Changing_our_Attention_Spans). But this is a personal blog, so you'll have to forgive me for eschewing brevity in favor of depth here in my corner of the Internet.

That said, I have a philosophy when it comes to ranking: top three only. Beyond that, comparisons get murkyâ€”different styles, different strengths, different techniques. Rather than stress myself out with [Keith Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Lee_(food_critic)) style metrics, I keep it simple with a top three. Everything else is good in its own right, but harder to rank definitively.  

So, here they areâ€”**my top three cinnamon rolls spots in Raleigh**:  

1. ðŸ¥‡ [**The Market Bakery**](#the-market-bakery)  
2. ðŸ¥ˆ [**Hereghty Heavenly Delicious**](#hereghty-heavenly-delicious)  
3. ðŸ¥‰ [**Morning Rolls**](#morning-rolls)  

Click through to each section for the full review. Beyond these rankings, the sections below contain all the spots I visited, listed in no particular order.

## Little Blue Bakehouse

This place is very well designed, modern, clean, and aesthetically delightful. The kind of spot where every offering looks photogenic and every pastry is placed just so. It's also home to a _massive_ cinnamon roll. They do not skimp on size, nor do they skimp on cream cheese frosting.

Now, the roll itself? A bit underwhelming. The texture leans firm, even after warming. The cream cheese frosting, while abundant, could have been sweeter. A good cinnamon roll, but not a great one. Still, worth a stop if you're in the area and appreciate a well curated cafÃ© space.

## Morning Rolls  

This place was highly recommended by locals and denizens of [r/raleigh](https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/) alike. Cinnamon rolls aren't just something they offer; they're what they _do_. They are to cinnamon rolls what Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is to actors playing themselves in moviesâ€”it's their specialty. And yet, I didn't love it. I tried, and while I enjoyed it, I just couldn't feel the fervor others seemed to have for their particular brand of cinnamon roll.

It's good, but it leans dry. The icing doesn't quite melt into the roll; it stays caked on top. The flavor is strong, and I respect their craft, but I prefer a bit more gooey texture in a warmed roll. Objectively, it's high quality. Subjectively, yeah...

However, no exploration of Raleigh's cinnamon roll scene feels complete without a stop at Morning Rolls, considering their reputation and the fact that they've won [several awards](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBoJsweRNQp). If you're in the area, certainly give them a try!

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3233.9466265504175!2d-78.6178646246554!3d35.85031227253312!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89ac5953ff807e97%3A0x3551e235dc60adf2!2sMorning%20Rolls!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1738376503197!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="100%" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

## Boulted Bread

I don't know if this is a consistent thing, but on the day I visited, they didn't have a proper cinnamon roll. What they did have was a morning bunâ€”close, but not the same. As you might have gathered from the sheer existence of this blog post, I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to cinnamon rolls, particularly the accuracy of the nomenclature surrounding their identification.  

A [_morning bun_](https://www.google.com/search?q=mornign+bun) is not a cinnamon roll.  
A [_coffee roll_](https://www.google.com/search?q=coffee+roll) is not a cinnamon roll.  
A [_sticky bun_](https://www.google.com/search?q=sticky+bun) is not a cinnamon roll.  
A [_Chelsea bun_](https://www.google.com/search?q=Chelsea+bun)â€”a respectable pastry in its own rightâ€”is also not a cinnamon roll.  

And for good measure, [College Park is not Atlanta](https://www.google.com/search?q=College+Park+is+not+Atlanta+Omeretta).

Now to be fair, Boulted Bread has an excellent local reputation and fantastic pastries overall. I'm fairly certain they occasionally carry cinnamon rollsâ€”I got the recommendation to check them out from someone who swore by them. With that in mind, [your mission, should you choose to accept it](https://www.google.com/search?q=Your+mission%2C+should+you+choose+to+accept+it+Mission+Impossible), is to visit Boulted Bread if you're ever in Raleigh and report back. If you do find cinnamon rolls, get one for yourself, and save one for me!

## Hereghty Heavenly Delicious  

Truly heavenly. The roll is large, the icing is abundant, and the texture is phenomenalâ€”flaky like a croissant but structured enough to maintain integrity. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so. It tastes just as good warm as it does cold, which is a rare achievement in the cinnamon roll world. Before I tried [_The Market Bakery_](#the-market-bakery), this was my undisputed #1 in Raleigh. Worth a visitâ€”not just for the cinnamon roll, but for the atmosphere. I spent a few hours here working on my laptop, then reading, pondering, moseying may way towards the New Year. The space has a calming presenceâ€”cozy, with dim, warm lighting and compact seating that feels snug rather than cramped. A great spot all around!

## The Market Bakery

**Amazing** might be an understatement here. No, it almost certainly is.

I fear my vocabulary is not sufficiently expressiveâ€”too meager a vessel, too feeble a vehicleâ€”to convey the magnitude of what I must say next. Honor demands it. The laws of both man and God cry out for it. That a man speak truth, setting aside personal feelings, bias, and preconceived notions in service of what he has experienced plain as dayâ€”what is so clear it cannot, by any matter of reason, be denied. That is to say: **_The Market Bakery_ in Raleigh, North Carolina, has done it. They have perfected the cinnamon roll.** They have given me the single greatest cinnamon roll experience I've ever had in all my God-fearing years.

I'm nearly brought to tears writing this. The memory alone of their cinnamon roll is enough to stir something deep in my soul. _The Market Bakery_ sits within a humble farmer's market, just a stone's throw from NC State's Centennial Campus. A modest space, shared among many businesses, yet within it lies a treasure, a gift to Raleigh, a gift to pastry lovers the world round, a gift to mankind.  

The cinnamon roll itself is masterfully craftedâ€”soft yet structured, delicate but not flaky like the many croissant-inspired imposters I encountered elsewhere in Raleigh. It holds its form, ensuring the icing seeps into every fold rather than sitting stiffly on top. Or, put another way, it is... 

<div class="meme-container">
  <div class="meme-wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/perfectly-balanced-meme.jpg" />
  </div>
</div>

The icing is applied with a true artisan's precisionâ€”generous but never excessive, sweet but never cloying. Many bakeries make the mistake of drowning their cinnamon rolls in icing (_looking at you, Cinnabon_), but _The Market Bakery_ achieves an equilibrium few have even dared to dream of. Warm or cold, it is transcendent. No exaggeration: it's the greatest cinnamon roll I've ever had. It's so divinely made that I found myself thanking <a href="/assets/images/JesusIsGod.png" target="_blank">God</a> for allowing humanity to experience such baked perfection.

If you're ever in Raleigh, you must come here. Every other place in this article can be ignoredâ€”this alone is worth the journey. But heed my warning: _arrive early_. This is a known commodity, and if you delay, you may find yourself standing in front of an empty display case, mourning what could have been. Move with all manner of immediate speed, and secure for yourself a cinnamon roll so celestial, so exquisitely formed, that it could bring even the most hardened of souls to their knees in reverence.

## Deja Brew Coffee House  

This is what I'd call an **economic** cinnamon roll. It's big, it's satisfying enough, but it's missing the extra touch that elevates a roll from good to great. The icing is too sparse, which is an issue because the roll itself is on the drier side.  

Would I tell someone to drive across town for this? Absolutely not. But if you're already here, it pairs well with a good cup of coffee. Bonus points for the atmosphereâ€”Deja Brew is a great spot to hang out in, homey vibes. However, if you want a more refined cinnamon roll experience, [_Morning Rolls_](#morning-rolls) is within walking distance. Do yourself a favor and compare the two.

## The Cupcake Shoppe

Lovely aesthetic, like something out of the Barbie movie. But they're a cupcake shop first, so you're not always guaranteed to find a cinnamon roll if you visit. When they do have them though, they're alright. Nothing remarkable, nothing dastardly either. If you're into cupcakes though, and cute aesthetics, this is definitely your spot.

## Cinnaholic

A delightful establishment, but it's not local to Raleigh. It's a chain with locations [across the country](https://locations.cinnaholic.com), each offering a unique cinnamon roll experience that's worth trying. Think of it as the Chipotle or Subway of cinnamon rolls, where you can customize your order to your liking. They offer over 20 options for both icing and frosting, which are not the same thing! Icing is thinner and glossier, while frosting is thicker and creamier. Most traditional cinnamon rolls use icing, but Cinnaholic provides choices like cream cheese frosting, cookie dough frosting, caramel frosting, and various toppings, allowing for extensive customization. I'm partial to their cookie dough frosting, and traditional _Old Skool_ cinnamon roll. It's truly a cinnamon roll lover's heaven, and I appreciate their locations in every city I find them.

## Sir Walter Coffee + Kitchen

Now this was a great cinnamon roll. They call it a cinnamon bun, but as someone with demonstrated expertise in this area, let me clarify that it's a cinnamon roll. Great cinnamon presence, just the right amount of icing, and a texture that's equally enjoyable warm or cold. The coffee shop itself has a great vibe tooâ€”cozy, warm, and welcoming. I'd absolutely return for both the cinnamon roll and the overall ambience. Raleigh did well with this one.

## 42 & Lawrence

A flaky, croissant-like crust that gives the roll a lighter, layered texture. Despite that, it doesn't fall into the trap of being too delicateâ€”this still holds up as a proper cinnamon roll. Just the right amount of icing and cinnamon, balanced and well-executed.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3236.945048413684!2d-78.63940862465908!3d35.77672617255654!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x89ac5f7288e3a325%3A0x367c2e6d8b03ee54!2s42%20%26%20Lawrence!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1738378472429!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="100%" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen=""  referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

## Benelux Cafe  

Not good. Not good at all. The roll was hardâ€”an unfortunate fate for any baked good, but especially tragic for a cinnamon roll, which should be the very definition of soft indulgence. The cream cheese icing was lacking in sweetness, and the cinnamon was applied with such a heavy hand that the edges burned in the baking process. A cinnamon roll should not taste **charred**. I wanted to like this, but it was a miss in every category. Skip it. But if you're into waffles, then definitely go here, because they excel at that. Good coffee too.

## The Third Place Coffee Shop

A cinnamon roll with a crunchier crust and softer interior, almost veering into _coffee roll_ territory. Certainly not bad, but not overwhelmingly good either. What makes this place stand out, though, is its nameâ€”_The Third Place_â€”which resonates with me because I [run a website](https://www.charlottethirdplaces.com/) dedicated to finding [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) in Charlotte (a Raleigh edition is in the works). For the vibes alone, it's worth checking out.

## Weaver Street Market

At first glance, it seems like there's not enough icing, but the roll itself is sweet and flaky, almost croissant-like, so it works. Definitely needs to be warm to bring out the best in it, but overall, a solid cinnamon roll. This is also a great place to hangout from and work remotely/study. The upstairs area is huge, and the store itself has everything you need to nestle in and stay a while.

## Brew Coffee Bar - McNeil Pointe

Flaky, croissant-like texture. The icing is more like a glazed donutâ€”dried onto the roll instead of staying soft. A bit messy, but still a solid cinnamon roll. Most importantly, I almost didn't get one. When I visited, the couple ahead of me ordered what the barista thought was the last cinnamon roll. But then she saw the disappointment, the pain, the despair in my eyes, and she graciously said, "let me check though, just to be sure."  

Lo and behold, they had one left. I devoured it with joy.

## Iris Coffee Lab  

This wasâ€¦fine. Nothing remarkable, nothing offensiveâ€”just a standard cinnamon roll that likely comes from a local bakery rather than being made in-house. If you're already at Iris for coffee, it's a serviceable pairing, but it's not the kind of cinnamon roll that would inspire an impassioned blog post (or even an impassioned sentence). 

If you're on a dedicated cinnamon roll hunt, I wouldn't go out of my way for this one. This is an excellent place to hangout and work/study though. Really great access to outlets, good coffee & tea, enough seating to feel confident about finding a spot, and energizing vibes with how bright they keep it.

## Gloria Jean's Coffee  

This is almost certainly a [Big Texas Cinnamon Roll](https://www.google.com/search?q=big+texas+cinnamon+roll)â€”the kind you find at gas stations, vending machines, and certain hotel lobbies that try just a little too hard with their continental breakfast. You know exactly what you're getting: a cinnamon roll-shaped sugar bomb with icing that's been fused into the pastry like a fossilized relic of artificial sweetness. Serviceable? Sure. Worth a dedicated visit? Not at all. 

If you're near Gloria Jean's and need a quick caffeine boost, go for the coffee. If you're after a cinnamon roll, walk away. And to be clear, this is a great coffee shop, it manages to be an oasis within a rather busy mall, it's just not a cinnamon roll standout.

## Giorgios Epicurean Market  

A fantastic market filled with high-quality European imports, fresh-baked bread, and gourmet ingredients. A great place to grab some wine, cheese, and specialty goodsâ€¦ but a cinnamon roll destination? Not quite. Their version leans heavily toward a **coffee roll**, which is a different pastry altogether. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly memorable either. If you find yourself at Giorgios, focus on what they do bestâ€”imported delicacies, artisanal groceries, and wonderful foodâ€”because cinnamon rolls aren't quite the main event here.

## Honorable Mentions  

While I didn't get the chance to visit most of these spots, they came highly recommended by locals and [r/raleigh](https://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/). If you find yourself in Raleigh and have an affinity for cinnamon rolls, they're worth checking out:

- [**Craft Public House**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iogFo69QTeJCAxVW9): A local favorite, especially for brunch. I've heard good things about their pastries, and their cinnamon rolls are said to be a standout. If you're in Cary, it's a spot to keep on your radar.

- [**A Place at the Table**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hmA4JvrB7XiurR3b6): This spot is one of a kind. _A Place at the Table_ is a **pay-what-you-can cafÃ©**, meaning you pay what youâ€™re able, pay it forward for someone else, or volunteer in exchange for a meal. Itâ€™s about community, dignity, and making good food accessible to everyone. I actually made it here, but it was near closing, and they were out of cinnamon rolls. A tragedy. If you go and manage to get one, report back!

- [**Yellow Dog Bread Company**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5jVHMwUNNnZek65y9): This bakery has a reputation for its pastries and neighborhood cafÃ© vibe. Their cinnamon rolls get a lot of love from the locals, and they were on my listâ€”I just ran out of time.

If you visit any of these places and try their cinnamon rolls, I'd love to [hear your thoughts](/contact)!

## Final Thoughts  

Raleigh has a serious cinnamon roll scene. Some places missed the mark, but [_The Market Bakery_](#the-market-bakery) set a new standard for me. If you love cinnamon rolls, you owe it to yourself to explore these spots, find your own favorite, and savor the process of discovery.

That said, this was a lot of writing, and I'm tired. If you actually read this entire article, please [contact me](/contact) because I want to be your friend. Anyways, Godspeed.
