## Some Background

Let me start off by saying I'm not an educator, at least not in the formal, "this is my actual day job" sense of the term. I'm a Software Engineer at a [company you've likely heard of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), but I've been fortunate that my role often lets me step into an educator's shoes. I've developed and delivered [STEM workshops](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#stem-workshops), [organized events](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microsoft_600-students-from-28-schools-across-north-ugcPost-7196494793907048449-6Oad), [collaborated with nonprofits](https://www.microsoft.com/insidetrack/blog/simplifying-nonprofit-volunteering-at-microsoft-with-power-automate/), presented to groups of [professionals looking to grow their skills](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pmicarolina_last-night-we-had-an-amazing-kick-off-event-ugcPost-7285305265048989696-ej4O), and worked directly with [students exploring tech and software engineering concepts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7264735736778690560-71lh/).

These experiences have deepened my appreciation for teaching ([it's hard](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9257066-if-you-want-to-learn-something-read-about-it-if)), and more importantly, for the power education has to change live. Not just as a cheesy ideal, but as a reality I've lived. It matters a great deal to me that students, especially those coming from socioeconomically challenged households (as I did ✋🏾), have opportunities to explore tech as a path out of hardship. And in that journey, there's perhaps no greater influence than educators. They're on the frontline connecting students to subjects that can lead to transformative, life-changing careers.

Right now, educators face a new challenge in AI. There's understandably a lot of anxiety surrounding it, but blanket bans don't really work, students always find ways around them. The moment they leave class, they'll be using AI. I recently came across a quote that captures this reality perfectly:

> Once we acknowledge that Generative AI is here to stay and most people will use it in their jobs in one way or another (including higher education STEM instructors!), it seems clear that we must teach students how to use it. At some point in their education, students learned to print, and some learned cursive writing. They learned to type, use a word processor, and use a calculator properly. Similarly, a tool as impactful as ChatGPT should be included in formal, potentially discipline-specific instruction.

## Parting Words  

The conversation around AI in education is evolving rapidly, and resources like the ones shared here are only the beginning. The tools and strategies available today are designed to help, not replace, the role of educators in shaping the next generation. Navigating this shift requires adaptation, but the core mission of education remains the same: to equip students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.  

For educators, accepting this reality means adjusting how they teach to ensure students are ready to succeed in a world that's fully embraced AI. Education's primary focus, its heartbeat, its guiding light, has always been preparing students to thrive, pursue their passions, and build better futures. If that requires educators to learn and understand new technology so they can bring that knowledge back to eager, curious minds, then so be it.

This isn't the first time in human history we've faced such change, and it won't be the last. Remaining stagnant and resistant to change does a disservice to students. It deprives them of the chance to engage with tools and develop skills that could shape their futures. Teach them what will help them thrive when the safety and sense of "I have time" that comes with being in school is no longer there. Don't shut yourself off to AI just because it's uncomfortable, because in the end, it's not you who will be most affected. It's the students looking to you to guide them.
