## Why I Love The Maze Runner

I discovered [*The Maze Runner*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner) during my freshman year of college while living in an overcrowded dorm with 5 roommates. Needless to say, I was in dire need of a hangout spot—and a time-consuming hobby—away from the confines of my room. Reading at length in the library provided me with just that. I'd pick up a book, find a comfortable nook, and post up for hours, reading as a form of much-needed escapism. My real life at the time was pretty rough, so novels, particularly in the young adult genre, were a place of refuge for me. In them, I found all sorts of heroes and stories that helped me forget my troubles, if only temporarily, and inspired me in many ways.

*The Maze Runner* was one such novel that grabbed my attention. It was my first page-turner. I'd finish a chapter, make a half-hearted attempt to do something else, and inevitably pick it back up, driven by the need to know what came next. Its mysteries captivated me. From chapter to chapter, I was absorbed by the journey of the protagonist Thomas, whose own confusion mirrored the chaos of the world around him. The library was my sanctuary at the time, and I remember hiding from security just so I could keep reading well after the building had closed for the day. The captivating story made it all worthwhile.

These days, many may know *The Maze Runner* as a [2014 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner_(film)) directed by Wes Ball. I saw the film on its opening night and had no issues with it at the time. However, as the sequels were released, I soured on the film series overall. In general, they received mixed reviews from the fandom, but we're not here to talk about movies. This article's all about books, specifically, the first book. I recently reread *The Maze Runner* and wanted to write the review I wish I had back when I first read it. So, here it is.

**Note:** If you haven't seen the movies, don't. At least not yet. Read the first book in the series and then decide if you'll hop to the films or continue with the novels. It's worth reading.

## Revisiting A Modern Classic

In [James Dashner's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dashner) post-apocalyptic young adult novel *The Maze Runner*, the world is shattered by a deadly disease known as "the Flare." Thomas and his friends, the Gladers, find themselves caught in the crosshairs of WICKED—the World in Catastrophe Killzone Experiment Department. This shadowy organization is bent on finding a cure, no matter the cost, employing methods that push the boundaries of morality. As the Gladers fight to survive and resist, the story explores the heavy clash between courage and control, love and loss, and the desperate lengths humanity will go to when the stakes are survival itself. At its core, it's a gripping tale of resilience and rebellion in a world on the brink.

From its opening pages, Dashner draws readers into a world of mystery. We follow Thomas as he finds himself in an enormous maze with no recollection of how he got there, or why it exists. Throughout the novel, readers are kept in suspense, unsure of what lies beyond the maze. As the story progresses, Thomas's journey of discovery includes many twists and turns, but also a great deal of emotional depth that makes it easy to feel invested in the story. The relationships between Thomas and the supporting characters are well crafted, leading the reader to form their own opinions on who to trust and who not to trust. The book's ending leaves you with a sense of resolution, but also raises questions about what seems to be an ever-expanding world of mystery. Thankfully, there are [sequels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner_(book_series))!

All in all, *The Maze Runner* is a true page-turner that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. With a price tag of just $10 at most bookstores (or free from your local library), the novel is well worth the investment. For me, it was the first book I ever read that made me feel like I just couldn't put it down. If you do end up reading it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
