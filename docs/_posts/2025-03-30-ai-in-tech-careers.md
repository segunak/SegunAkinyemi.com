## Artificial Intelligence in Tech Careers

Artifical Intellginece (AI) is far from just being a buzzword these days. As someone working as a software engineer at [a company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) you've likely heard of that's behind many leading AI products (including ownership of [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) and thus its suite of [Copilot AI Coding tools](https://github.com/features/copilot), a significant [stake in OpenAI](https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/microsoft-openai-equity-stake-nonprofit-for-profit-reorganization-sam-altman/) as their cloud provider, creators of [VSCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code), and owners of [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn)), I can tell you that AI's impact is very real. I open my laptop every day to a flood of emails from organization leaders, managers, and various divisions encouraging the use of AI tools to make us work faster, be more efficient, and most notably, write code. The AI coding revolution is not a fad. There's evne new kinds of terms popping up to describe it like [Natural Language Programming](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/natural-language-programming/) and [Vibecoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). Companies actively want employees to use these tools. They're doing everything to make adoption as easy and smooth as possible, and the more you use these tools, the more you understand why. They're [seriously good](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/). If you're entering or growing in a tech career today, embracing AI isn't optional—it's essential.

## The State of AI in Tech

If you're entering the tech industry today without a strategy for how you'll use AI, you're putting yourself at a serious disadvantage. I promise you I'm not being dramatic,—AI is dramatically reshaping how we build software, design products, analyze data, and even how we communicate technical concepts.

The tools available now make tasks that once took hours take minutes. Code that would've required deep expertise in specific languages can now be generated and explained through natural language conversations. Systems that once needed teams of engineers can now be prototyped by individuals with the right AI-assisted tools.

As I wrote in my article [GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode Is Rather Impressive](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/), the landscape is changing rapidly:

> One thing is for sure, if we as developers don't adapt, we're more than cooked, we're royally fried. [...] No company will pass up a tool that makes developers faster and more effective. So, yes—developers will have to adapt. Some jobs will almost certainly be lost, especially among those who refuse AI-assisted development. When one developer using AI can do the work of several, fewer will be needed.

Does this mean you shouldn't pursue a tech career? Absolutely not! It means you should pursue it with eyes wide open, embracing AI as your copilot rather than seeing it as your replacement.

## AI's Impact on Software Engineering

As a software engineer at [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), I'm living through this AI transformation in real-time, and I want to be completely honest with you: the relationship between AI and software engineering is changing dramatically right before our eyes.

I'm not speaking as someone who has it all figured out—far from it. I'm speaking as someone who opens their laptop each morning to see new AI tools rolling out that fundamentally change how I work. I'm trying to adapt just like everyone else, and I want to share what I'm seeing from the inside.

AI tools aren't just changing how we write code—they're reshaping how we debug, how we collaborate, how we architect systems, and even how we think about what a developer actually does. Most companies aren't just experimenting with tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/#project-padawan-swe-agents-on-github) anymore; they're integrating them into standard workflows and expecting engineers to use them.

In my experience writing about [GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/), I compared modern developers to pilots:

> Think about the history of flying. Pilots used to do a lot manually. Then computers came along, and things got easier. We've now reached a point where modern pilots spend most of a flight on autopilot, with the computer doing the bulk of the flying. The human pilots are largely relegated to oversight, takeoff, landing, and stepping in when things go wrong. But here's the key: pilots still have to be experts.

I'm not going to sugarcoat this: [adapt or die](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+adapt+or+die+mean). It sounds harsh, but it's the reality we're facing. The good news? There's absolutely a future in software engineering—it just looks different than it did before. The developers who thrive will be those who can collaborate effectively with AI tools rather than compete against them.

## How I'm Trying to Adapt (And You Can Too)

Here's how I'm personally navigating this shift, with the hope it helps you too:

1. **Embrace AI tools as partners, not threats** - I've stopped resisting and started experimenting with these tools daily, learning their strengths and limitations through practice.

2. **Focus on understanding systems, not memorizing syntax** - Since AI can handle much of the coding details, I'm spending more energy understanding the bigger picture of how systems work together.

3. **Practice "prompting" like it's a programming language** - I'm literally practicing how to communicate with AI models effectively, treating it as a crucial skill just like learning a new programming language.

4. **Expand beyond my comfort zone** - With AI assistance, I'm working with technologies I previously would have avoided because I didn't know them well enough.

5. **Double down on human skills** - I'm investing more in communication, collaboration, and creative problem-solving because these are areas where humans still have a significant edge.

I don't have all the answers, and I'm figuring this out day by day just like you might be. But I do know that resisting this change isn't an option. The software engineers who embrace AI as a partner rather than fearing it as a replacement are the ones who will not just survive but thrive in the next chapter of our industry.

We're all in this together, trying to navigate a rapidly changing landscape. The future of software engineering isn't about being replaced by AI—it's about becoming a new kind of engineer who knows how to harness AI's power effectively.

## Essential AI Tools for Tech Professionals

Let's talk about AI tools that are rapidly catching on with tech professionals. I'm not talking about just using chatbots—you've probably heard of ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and plenty of others. But that's not what this section is about. Instead, I want to highlight tools that tech professionals are using **to build software** beyond having to copy/paste things into a chat window. These are tools embedded directly into the workflow of those working in tech.

I personally use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) so much it's totally changed my work life. I spend more time writing technical pseudocode and then validating what AI generated than I do writing code by hand. And I freaking love it! I can't describe how much it lets me focus on what I'm building rather than having 20 tabs open to look up syntax.

Explore these tools with the mindset of "these are the sorts of things AI builders use." Because while everyone and their mama is using AI like ChatGPT, this is different - this is the AI stuff people use day-to-day to be part of building the future of software with AI.
