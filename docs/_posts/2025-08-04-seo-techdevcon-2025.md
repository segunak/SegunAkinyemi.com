## What Is AI Engineering?

It's still a relatively new term, although [it's going mainstream](https://www.latent.space/p/aiewf-2025-keynotes), but here's my attempt at a definition.

> AI Engineering is the practice of building software that connects AI models to real-world systems and knowledge. While Machine Learning Engineers create the models, AI Engineers make them useful by providing the right context, tools, and interfaces for specific applications.

**[Real Spill:](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=real+spill)** AI Engineering is just the evolution of Software Engineering. Most AI Engineers today still have "Software Engineer" or "Software Developer" as their job title, and probably will for a while.
{: .notice--warning}

I created this visual to illustrate what AI Engineering means in practice. It's not perfect, but it gets the point across:

![AI Engineer Image](/assets/images/AI-Engineer-Graph.png)

**Aside:** The image shows AI Engineer as the #1 fastest growing job title, which comes from [LinkedIn's 2025 Jobs on the Rise report](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-jobs-rise-2025-25-fastest-growing-us-linkedin-news-gryie).
{: .notice--info}

Think of it this way. They're both athletes, but in different sports.

Maybe Machine Learning Engineers are playing baseball while AI Engineers are playing basketball. Both benefit from being athletic (technical skills), but they're different sports requiring different tactics, and one is harder (baseball is harder than basketball, don't @ me).

Or maybe it's more like Machine Learning Engineers build the engine and AI Engineers build the car around it, customizing for how different kinds of people plan to use it.

I don't know, no analogy is perfect. The point is, Machine Learning Engineers build the models, and AI Engineers take those models and build with them.

The term was popularized by [Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer).

> I think it is a full time job. I think software engineering will spawn a new subdiscipline, specializing in applications of AI and wielding the emerging stack effectively...The emerging (and least cringe) version of this role seems to be: AI Engineer.
>
> [The Rise of the AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer)

And it's got approval from [Andrej Karpathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy), former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI co-founder, and one of the most influential voices in the AI community.

> In numbers, there's probably going to be significantly more AI Engineers than there are ML engineers / LLM engineers. One can be quite successful in this role without ever training anything.
>
> [Andrej Karpathy on Twitter](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1674873002314563584)

Another term you might hear is [Context Engineering](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering), which is essentially the same thing.

> Context Engineering is the discipline of designing and building dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools, in the right format, at the right time, to give an LLM everything it needs to accomplish a task.
>
> [Philipp Schmid of Google DeepMind](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering)

The terms are still evolving in this space, but both have caught on because they capture the same core idea. Making AI useful by giving it the right context.

## It's Easier, and That's a Good Thing

At first glance, the term "AI Engineering" might sound intimidating, but let's keep things <s>real</s> 💯. It's way easier than being a Machine Learning Engineer.

To be a proper Machine Learning Engineer, you need to be good at math. Like, really good.

We're talking calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability theory, all that. And it's customary for them to have PhDs. To command the kind of respect that researchers at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta have right now, you'd need one.

Your path to being one of those people Mark Zuckerberg is throwing [pro-athlete level contracts at](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-sam-altman-140d5861) is much longer and harder than your path to being an AI Engineer...where you can make a solid 6 figures at companies that already hire software developers.

I'm not alone in this sentiment:

> In the near future, nobody will recommend starting in AI Engineering by reading [Attention is All You Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need), just like you do not start driving by reading the schematics for the [Ford Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T).
>
> [The Rise of the AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer)

**Aside:** [_Attention is All You Need_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) is the research paper by Google that introduced [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)), the "T" in GPT. It's a Machine Learning hallmark that paved the way for what eventually became OpenAI's ChatGPT.
{: .notice--info}

Funny thing is, I actually told people to read that paper in my [AI learning guide](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-learning-resources/#diving-deep). But you know what? I was wrong. You don't need to go that deep to get paid in this field. You can, and should if you're _truly_ that passionate about AI, but to have a tech career both now and in the future, it's not a must.

For me, you, and anyone wanting a tech career who isn't great at math or trying to get a PhD, our reaction to the rise of AI Engineers should be:

  </div>
</div>

## Why Coding Still Matters

You can't build serious systems, the kind companies up and down the Fortune 500 actually want, if you don't understand code.

[Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_codin) in its truest sense (no code review, just the end result) is not a real thing for people with paying jobs. [There are no shortcuts to mastery](https://shiftmag.dev/the-illusion-of-vibe-coding-5297/).

To all my "vibe coding will get me hired in tech" people out there, I love you, but...

<div class="meme-container">
  <div class="meme-wrapper">
    <img alt="Not Serious People" src="/assets/images/succession-not-serious-people.gif"/>
  </div>
</div>

**Aside:** I haven't watched Succession, [and neither has Brian Cox](https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/brian-cox-did-not-watch-succession-1234874252/), the actor in that gif. We're both in agreement about avoiding good but stressful shows about deeply narcissistic, conceited, hedonistic people. I need at least one bastion of morality in my shows these days. Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen before her [tragic character assassination](https://michaeljohnhalse.wixsite.com/michaeljohnhalse/post/2019/05/13/the-character-assassination-of-daenerys-targaryen), are what got me through [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones). I need someone good, man. Someone.
{: .notice--info}

Yes, AI can (and should) generate code for you, but if you have no idea what it's doing, you're flying blind. And no serious company is going to pay you to blindly copy-paste AI-generated code into their mission-critical (military, healthcare, infrastructure, financial, government, etc.) systems.

Sorry if that's harsh, but I want to be sure I don't have to go full...

  <div class="meme-wrapper">
    <img alt="Justin Bieber Not Clocking to You" src="/assets/images/justin-bieber-clocking-to-you.gif"/>
  </div>
</div>

...to get this point across.

So, are tech jobs going away? No! But they are for sure changing.

[Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) says [the world wants 1000x more software](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/sam-altman-says-world-wants-1000x-more-software). The [CEO of GitHub](https://ashtom.github.io/developer-odyssey) says we need more programmers than ever. I've written extensively about this in my [AI in tech careers](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-in-tech-careers/) post.

But the most compelling perspective comes from [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). He co-founded [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) (they invented the ["T" in ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain#Transformer)), was Chief Scientist at [Baidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu), co-founded [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera), and founded [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). The entire Machine Learning community looks to him for training and guidance. His [perspective](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_deepseek-r1-uncensored-qwq-32b-puts-reasoning-activity-7305984835708141570-XVKU) on AI's impact on programming carries serious weight:

</p>

Learning to code today isn't about prepping for a future where you type every line yourself. We haven't been doing that even before AI. [High-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), [Stack Overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow) copy/paste, [low-code tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform), we've been doing anything and everything to make it easier to create software for a while now.

The future is being technical enough to orchestrate AI while you handle the problems that need human judgment.

Writing effective prompts, catching when AI hallucinates garbage, and debugging when things inevitably break. Those are the things no serious company will ever [trust solely to a machine](/assets/images/ibm-slide.jpg), and they're what make you valuable and get you paid.

But you can only do these things if you can read and understand code, generate it with very specific prompts (essentially [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)), and occasionally, write it when needed.

## AI in the Real World

Check out this [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1mrdn6m/our_ceo_confirmed_ai_will_not_be_taking_our_jobs/) where software engineers and CTOs share their experiences with AI in the workplace. Companies that tried to replace humans with AI are regretting it, while those using AI to make their technical teams more efficient are getting more ambitious about projects. The result is more work than ever and a greater need for skilled humans who can use AI effectively.

This tracks with what [Sam Altman said](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/sam-altman-says-world-wants-1000x-more-software) about the world wanting "1000x more software." AI makes developers more productive (well...[it depends](https://fortune.com/2025/07/20/ai-hampers-productivity-software-developers-productivity-study/)), which means companies can tackle bigger projects and expand into new areas. Instead of replacing developers, this creates more demand for people who understand both technology and how to leverage AI tools.

For the technical analysis on why this happens, check out [Why LLMs Can't Really Build Software](https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software). It explains exactly why AI struggles with the mental models and iterative problem-solving that experienced developers excel at. The community discussions about that article on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900116) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1mqw1d1/why_llms_cant_really_build_software_zed_blog/) are also very insightful.

When it comes to building software, AI helps humans get things done. It doesn't eliminate the need for them. It's been a minute since OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022. We're not guessing anymore about how it's impacting the industry. We know. AI Engineering is a real thing, and it's the future of the field. One that keeps humans in the loop. Rejoice!

## What to Learn

If you ever thought you could be a Software Engineer (or Software Developer, literally the same thing, don't let anyone tell you otherwise), then you can be an AI Engineer.

The same fundamental skill of coding is required, but you also need a solid understanding of the technical areas that AI Engineers (mostly still called Software Engineers) work with day-to-day.

Many of these are areas that real-world software engineers already deal with. Its the stuff beyond just coding that often surprises new grads when they start building production systems at scale.

Here's what you'll need to get familiar with:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Data Stuff</summary>

AI systems are only as good as the data they work with. To make data "AI-ready," you need to organize it so AI can find answers quickly.

AI doesn't understand text like we do. It converts everything into numbers called **vectors** (think of them as coordinates that capture meaning).

A **vector database** is like a search engine built for these numbers, letting AI find similar content even if the exact words don't match. This is called **semantic search**, which means searching by meaning, not just keywords.

* **Vector Databases**: [Postgres](https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/) with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search). These store and search vectors efficiently.
* **Vector Indexes & Optimization**: [Vector indexes](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/concepts/vector-index), [Vector optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-configure-compression-storage) and [index strategies](https://medium.com/@myscale/understanding-vector-indexing-a-comprehensive-guide-d1abe36ccd3c) for fast data retrieval.
* **Embeddings & Indexing**: Understanding [vector embeddings](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings), which is how text gets converted to numbers that capture its meaning.
* **Basic SQL & Data Foundations**: Still the backbone of all data work. Even [Apache Spark uses SQL syntax](https://spark.apache.org/sql/) as the preferred interface.

</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>AI-Specific Technologies</summary>

* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Understanding [what RAG is](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation), and [building RAG systems](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/) to connect AI to a company's data.
* **Cache Augmented Generation (CAG)**: Optimizing AI responses with [intelligent caching strategies](https://www.anthropic.com/news/prompt-caching), which some are saying is the [successor to RAG](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.15605v1).
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: [Connecting AI to external systems](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview), the foundation of agentic AI.
* **Model Selection & Evaluation**: Choosing between GPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc. based on [cost, performance, and use case](https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/models).
* **Responsible AI**: [Bias detection](https://leena.ai/blog/mitigating-bias-in-ai/), [content filtering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/content-filtering), [ethical AI practices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai).

<details markdown="1">
<summary>System Architecture</summary>

* **APIs**: Building and consuming [REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design), understanding [OpenAPI specifications](https://learn.openapis.org/) for AI-discoverable APIs, and [API versioning strategies](https://restfulapi.net/versioning/) for maintaining production systems.
* **System Design**: [Designing scalable AI systems](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-developers-guide-to-building-scalable-ai-workflows-vs-agents/) that don't [crash under load](https://forgecode.dev/blog/gcp-cloudflare-anthropic-outage/).
* **Networking**: A basic understanding of [computer networking](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/introduction-to-networking/) because AI runs on...computers. Cloud Networking, specific to the service provider you're building with (guides for [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/fundamentals/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/google-cloud-networking-101-quick-reference-guide), and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cloud-networking/)), how data flows between services ([ETL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/data-guide/relational-data/etl)), [load balancing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/), [CDNs](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/).
* **Cloud Platforms**: [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/training/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/training). Pick one and dive in, entire careers are built just understanding one of these.

<summary>Tools to Focus On</summary>

Stick with what most companies use. Don't chase every hot new tool from a startup that'll eventually be acquired by big tech (looking at you [Windsurf](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/cognition-to-buy-ai-startup-windsurf-days-after-google-poached-ceo.html), [Replit](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/in-a-blow-to-google-cloud-replit-partners-with-microsoft/), [Inflection](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/how-microsoft-lured-inflection-ai-s-staff-to-abandon-the-startup), and eventually, [Cursor](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/)).

* [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The IDE everyone uses. Even [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is just a VS Code fork. The industry isn't leaving VS Code. Microsoft's vertical integration owning it and GitHub and Azure and a chunk of OpenAI is insane. Investing in being a VS Code power user is time well spent.
* [**GitHub Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot/tutorials): Free for students. GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so it's integrated everywhere. Specifically, it's the preferred AI coding tool of VS Code.
* [**Claude Code**](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code): Terminal-based AI-coding tool that works with any IDE (including VS Code). From Anthropic, it's the real deal. A competitor to GitHub Copilot. Amazon is behind Anthropic, so this product has staying power.
* [**GitHub Spark**](https://github.com/features/spark): GitHub's answer to vibe coding tools like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/). Great for personal projects, micro apps, [greenfield development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project), prototypes, etc.

## Landing a Tech Job

The shortest and sweetest advice I can give is apply early and often. It took me 112 applications back in 2020, 3 of which resulted in interviews, and only 1 of which resulted in an offer, to get in with [my current employer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft).

Some people might hear that and think:

<div class="meme-container">
  <div class="meme-wrapper">
    <img alt="Aint Nobody Got Time for That" src="/assets/images/aint-nobody-got-time-for-that.gif"/>
  </div>
</div>

But that's what it takes. You've got to [hustle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEVLvBRB96Y), [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVwyrk3Ftc4).

If you're in college, literally when you arrive on campus in the Fall, it's time to apply for internships. Set aside a few minutes every day, download LinkedIn to find positions, use [Easy Apply](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a512388), set up job alerts on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/).

If your goal is big tech, check the [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/students), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/students), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/career-programs/university), [Meta](https://www.metacareers.com/careerprograms/students), and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/careers/us/work-at-apple/students.html) student career pages regularly. The big tech companies are always posting, and sometimes at different stages, so you really got to keep an eye on their websites.

I've written extensively about this in my [AI in Tech Careers](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-in-tech-careers/) and [Miscellaneous Tech Career Advice](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/miscellaneous-tech-career-advice/) posts. But honestly, if you're with [SEO](https://tech.seo-usa.org/), you're probably doing just fine with finding internships as they have great resources.
