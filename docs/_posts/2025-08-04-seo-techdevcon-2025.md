## What's Up

![KakashiWaving](/assets/images/kakashi-hello.gif)

Welcome! If you're reading this, you probably scanned a QR code during my workshop at [SEO's](https://www.seo-usa.org/) 2025 [Tech Developer Conference](https://tech.seo-usa.org/) in New York.

I posted this before the workshop, so I hope you're like "_that session was awesome_" right now 😅. Or at the very least, I hope you enjoyed the fruit snacks if you got a swag bag.

**Aside:** [Funables](https://www.funablessnacks.com/) are the apex fruit snack. Don't talk to me about [Welch's](https://welchsfruitsnacks.com/). I know you grew up with them, so did I, but they're _trash_. [Motts](https://www.motts.com/products/fruit-snacks), _trash_. [Annie's](https://www.annies.com/products/fruit-snacks), _trash_. [Gushers](https://www.gushers.com/), _not a real fruit snack_. [Black Forest](https://www.blackforestusa.com/fruit-snacks), _decent_. [Scooby Doo](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Scooby-Doo-Fruit-Flavored-Snacks-Treat-Pouches-Gluten-Free-Value-Pack-22-Ct-17-6-oz/901230707), _mid_.

## What Is AI Engineering?

Keep in mind, it's still a relatively new term, although [it's going mainstream](https://www.latent.space/p/aiewf-2025-keynotes), but here's my attempt at a definition.

> AI Engineering is the practice of building software that connects AI models to real-world systems and knowledge. While Machine Learning Engineers create the models, AI Engineers make them useful by providing the right context, tools, and interfaces for specific applications.

Think of it this way. They're both athletes, but in different sports. Maybe Machine Learning Engineers are playing baseball while AI Engineers are playing basketball. Both benefit from being athletic (technical skills), but they're different sports requiring different tactics, and one is harder (baseball is harder than basketball, don't @ me).

Or maybe it's more like Machine Learning Engineers build the engine and AI Engineers build the car around it, customizing it for how different kinds of people plan to use it. I don't know, no analogy is perfect. The point is, Machine Learning Engineers build the models, and AI Engineers take those models and build with them.

The term was popularized by [Latent Space](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer).

> I think it is a full time job. I think software engineering will spawn a new subdiscipline, specializing in applications of AI and wielding the emerging stack effectively...The emerging (and least cringe) version of this role seems to be: AI Engineer.
>
> [The Rise of the AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer)

And it's got approval from [Andrej Karpathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy), former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI co-founder, and one of the most influential voices in the AI community.

> In numbers, there's probably going to be significantly more AI Engineers than there are ML engineers / LLM engineers. One can be quite successful in this role without ever training anything.
>
> [Andrej Karpathy on Twitter](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1674873002314563584)

Another term you might hear is [Context Engineering](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering), which is essentially the same thing.

> Context Engineering is the discipline of designing and building dynamic systems that provide the right information and tools, in the right format, at the right time, to give an LLM everything it needs to accomplish a task.
>
> [Philipp Schmid of Google DeepMind](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering)

The terms are still evolving in this space, but both have caught on because they capture the same core idea. Making AI useful by giving it the right context.

## It's Easier, and That's a Good Thing

At first glance, the term "AI Engineering" might sound intimidating, but let's keep it <s>real</s> 💯. It's way easier than being a Machine Learning Engineer.

To be a proper Machine Learning Engineer, you need to be good at math. Like, really good. We're talking calculus, linear algebra, statistics, probability theory, all that. And it's customary for them to have PhDs. To command the kind of respect that researchers at OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta have right now, you'd need one.

Your path to being one of those people Mark Zuckerberg is throwing [pro-athlete level contracts at](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-recruiting-mark-zuckerberg-sam-altman-140d5861) is much longer and harder than your path to making a solid 6 figures as an AI Engineer at any company that already hires software developers.

I'm not alone in this sentiment:

> In the near future, nobody will recommend starting in AI Engineering by reading [Attention is All You Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need), just like you do not start driving by reading the schematics for the [Ford Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T).
>
> [The Rise of the AI Engineer](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer)

**Aside:** _Attention is All You Need_ is the research paper by Google that introduced [transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)), the "T" in GPT. It's a Machine Learning hallmark, credited with paving the way for what eventually became OpenAI's ChatGPT.
{: .notice--info}

Funny thing is, I actually told people to read that paper in my [AI learning resources guide](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-learning-resources/#diving-deep). But you know what? I was wrong. You don't need to go that deep to get paid in this field. You can, and should if you're _truly_ that passionate about AI, but to have a tech career both now and in the future, it's not a must.

For me, for you, and for anyone who wants a tech career but isn't great at math or eager to pursue a PhD, being an AI Engineer?

<div class="meme-container">
  <div class="meme-wrapper">
    <img alt="Gimli saying Aye I could do that" src="/assets/images/gimli-aye-i-could-do-that-lotr.gif"/>
  </div>
</div>

If you ever thought you could be a Software Engineer (or Software Developer, literally the same thing, don't let anyone tell you otherwise), then you can be an AI Engineer.

The same fundamental skill of coding is required, but you also need a solid understanding of tech stuff like APIs, databases, networking, DevOps, and system design.

These aren't things you need a PhD to learn. You don't even really need a bachelor's (although it certainly helps). You can [learn all this stuff online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/).

## Why Coding Still Matters

You can't build serious systems, the kind companies up and down the Fortune 500 actually want (not your [vibe coded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) to-do app), if you don't understand code.

Yes, AI can (and should) generate code for you, but if you have no idea what it's doing, you're flying blind. And no serious company is going to pay you to blindly copy-paste AI-generated code into their mission-critical (military, healthcare, infrastructure, financial, government, etc.) systems.

You wouldn't trust a pilot who can use autopilot but can't actually fly the plane. Denzel proves as much in [Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_(2012_film)) (great film). AI is your copilot, not your replacement. At least, [not yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence).

So are tech jobs going away? No! But they're changing. [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) says [the world wants 1000x more software](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/sam-altman-says-world-wants-1000x-more-software). The [CEO of GitHub](https://ashtom.github.io/developer-odyssey) says we need more programmers than ever. I've written extensively about this in my [AI in tech careers](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-in-tech-careers/) post.

But the most compelling perspective comes from [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng). This guy co-founded [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) (they invented the ["T" in ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain#Transformer)), was Chief Scientist at [Baidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu), co-founded [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera), and founded [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). The entire Machine Learning community looks to him for training and guidance. His [perspective](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_deepseek-r1-uncensored-qwq-32b-puts-reasoning-activity-7305984835708141570-XVKU) on AI's impact on programming carries serious weight:

<p>
    <iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7305984835037118464" height="430px" width="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="LinkedIn Post"></iframe>
</p>

Learning to code today isn't about manually typing every single line. It's about understanding how systems actually work so you can write effective prompts, catch when AI hallucinates garbage, and debug when things inevitably break.

The future is being technical enough to orchestrate AI while you handle the problems that need human judgment. Those decisions no serious company will ever trust to a machine are what make you valuable and get you paid.

Take choosing which model your company's AI chatbot uses. That's not a decision you want AI making for you. Money's involved. We need people to build AI systems, not sit there asking AI how to build AI systems. Like, wtf. That's exactly why coding, or really the ability to read and understand code, still matters.

### Tools to Focus On

Stick with what most companies use. Don't chase every hot new tool from a startup that'll eventually be acquired by big tech (looking at you [Windsurf](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/cognition-to-buy-ai-startup-windsurf-days-after-google-poached-ceo.html), [Replit](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/in-a-blow-to-google-cloud-replit-partners-with-microsoft/), [Inflection](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/how-microsoft-lured-inflection-ai-s-staff-to-abandon-the-startup), and eventually, [Cursor](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/22/why-openai-wanted-to-buy-cursor-but-opted-for-the-fast-growing-windsurf/)).

* [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The IDE everyone uses. Even [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is just a VS Code fork. The industry isn't leaving VS Code. Microsoft's vertical integration owning it and GitHub and Azure and a chunk of OpenAI is insane. Investing in being a VS Code power user is time well spent.
* [**GitHub Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot/tutorials): Free for students. GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so it's integrated everywhere. Specifically, it's the preferred AI coding tool of VS Code.
* [**Claude Code**](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code): Terminal-based AI-coding tool that works with any IDE (including VS Code). From Anthropic, it's the real deal. A competitor to GitHub Copilot. Amazon is behind Anthropic, so this product has staying power.
* [**GitHub Spark**](https://github.com/features/spark): GitHub's answer to natural language app builders like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/). Great for personal projects, micro apps, [greenfield development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project), prototypes, etc.

## Who to Follow

The tech community lives more on LinkedIn, Twitter (will always be its name to me), Reddit, and Hacker News than TikTok, Instagram, or Snapchat. Tech people usually want to post and discuss without needing a picture or video to accompany it. Make a Twitter account just to follow these people if you need to.

## Landing a Tech Job

The shortest and sweetest advice I can give is apply early and often. It took me 112 applications back in 2020, 3 of which resulted in interviews, and only 1 of which resulted in an offer, to get in with [my current employer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft).

If you're in college, literally when you arrive on campus in the Fall, it's time to apply for internships. Set aside a few minutes every day, download LinkedIn to find positions, use [Easy Apply](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a512388), set up job alerts on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). If your goal is big tech, check the [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/students), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/students), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/career-programs/university), [Meta](https://www.metacareers.com/careerprograms/students), and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/careers/us/work-at-apple/students.html) student career pages every day. The big tech companies are always posting, and sometimes at different stages, so you really got to keep an eye on their websites.

I've written extensively about this in my [AI in Tech Careers](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/ai-in-tech-careers/) and [Miscellaneous Tech Career Advice](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/miscellaneous-tech-career-advice/) posts. But honestly, if you're with [SEO](https://tech.seo-usa.org/), you're probably doing just fine with finding internships as they have great resources.

For those specifically interested in Microsoft:

* **[Microsoft Recruiters LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14490227/):** This group isn't discoverable through search, someone's got to send you the link, and I just did. If you want a Microsoft internship, join this group NOW and keep an eye on it. Recruiters post opportunities here first.
* [Microsoft Careers](https://careers.microsoft.com/): Main careers site, bookmark it.
* [Early in Profession](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/programs/students.html): Your hub for internships and early career opportunities.
* [Explore Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/exploremicrosoft): Special internship program for college freshmen and sophomores.
* [Microsoft Hiring Tips](https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/hiring-tips): Microsoft specific tips on what they're looking for.
* [Career Paths at Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/): Details on the many career paths, including many that aren't technical and don't require any coding or understanding of tech, at Microsoft.
* [Student Certifications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/student-hub/certifications): Microsoft lets students take certification exams for free. Good stuff to throw on your resume.
* [Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/): Become a Microsoft rep on your campus.
