## Some Background

It's summer, it's hot, I just saw the [new Superman movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film)) (it's incredible, bravo [James Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn)), and I'm fresh off another edition of my [Discovery Day program](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7298003609416355840-JkVI). It's a field trip where students visit [my employer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) office in [Charlotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina) for a full day of career exploration, STEM activities, and networking.

For this latest one, I created a new workshop using the [Petoi 'Bittle X' Robot Dog](https://www.petoi.com/products/petoi-robot-dog-bittle-x-voice-controlled), which features a [fun new addition](https://docs.petoi.com/extensible-modules/robot-arm) to its capabilities. I continue [with my habit](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#stem-education) of taking what I'm learning as a software engineer and bringing it to students in ways that are approachable, fun, but most importantly, relevant. We need to teach them skills that'll actually land them tech jobs in this new _age of AI_. Things have gone far beyond [just learn to code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learn_to_Code). These days, if your approach to STEM Education doesn't involve addressing the impact of AI on the field, you're doing your students a disservice.

Tech workers everywhere are getting [yeeted](https://www.google.com/search?q=yeeted+definition) by AI, either into increased productivity or the [shadow realm](https://layoffs.fyi/). It's not a fad, it's changing the way we work. It's already made my job way different. A lot of my time is spent directing AI to write code, albeit with rather technically dense prompts, rather than writing it all myself. And beyond that, it's proven invaluable for research tasks. Gone are the days of having 30 tabs open troubleshooting an issue. A back and forth conversation powered by good prompts can get you the information you need faster than ever. It's undeniable, AI is the real deal, and it's here to stay.

## Petoi's New Product: The Robot Arm

I've had something of a love affair with [Petoi's](https://www.petoi.com/) products when it comes to engaging students of all ages in my workshops. Check out some [local news coverage](https://www.wcnc.com/video/news/local/microsoft-hosts-students-for-discovery-day/275-15fcdc4a-f87d-46bf-ae28-d0e4c6050c3d) and [my LinkedIn recap](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7264735736778690560-71lh) of an event I hosted featuring their [Bittle X](https://www.petoi.com/products/petoi-robot-dog-bittle-x-voice-controlled). It's safe to say I'm a fan of their stuff. The Bittle grabs students instantly with the "wow" factor. Once you have their attention, it's easy to teach them real skills. They can control the dog [with their voice](https://docs.petoi.com/extensible-modules/voice-command-module), use a [block-based programming tool](https://docs.petoi.com/block-based-programming/petoi-coding-blocks), or dive into [Python](https://docs.petoi.com/apis/python-api) (my preference).

So when they recently introduced a new product to their lineup, a [robot arm](https://docs.petoi.com/extensible-modules/robot-arm) that can be bought [as a separate attachment](https://www.petoi.com/products/bittle-arm-extension-with-metal-servos?srsltid=AfmBOoq_sxjG8o6hx225aGZ60i1OupGrO-Y61acislPen_5ysaHz9UMG) or purchased [with a new dog](https://www.petoi.com/products/petoi-robot-dog-bittle-x-voice-controlled), I was all in. It's an awesome addition to their [already impressive lineup](https://www.petoi.com/collections/petoi-bittle-accessories) of extensions. What makes it specifically cool for workshops is the precision required to control it. Students quickly learn that being specific matters when dealing with technology, whether they're using code, prompt engineering, or voice commands. I was fortunate enough to receive one free of charge for use in my workshops, and I finally got the chance to cook something up with it. The workshop I created works with both the arm-equipped Bittle and the standard Bittle X, all while tackling the topic that's on every tech worker's mind these days: artificial intelligence.
