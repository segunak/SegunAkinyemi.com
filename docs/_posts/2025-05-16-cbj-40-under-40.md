Popping in to share something unrelated to [tech](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#tech) or [AI](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#artificial-intelligence) or [entertainment](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#entertainment) or [cinnamon rolls](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#dough-diaries) or the many [various things](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/) I write about that aren't overly personal. This post is a rare occurrence, the topic at hand is just me. It feels a bit self-indulgent, but this is a personal blog—so it's not exactly out of place—and with that in mind, let's get to it.

I was recently selected to the 2025 [Charlotte Business Journal 40 Under 40](https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/c/40-under-40-2025-winners.html). The honor comes with a profile in their journal, which you can check out below.

**Now...you may have noticed, it's behind a paywall!**

You can view the print version [here](/assets/images/NewspaperPage-40Under40.jpg), but since I wrote and submitted the content myself (and I tend to be a bit verbose—which you'll notice if you poke around this blog), the Business Journal did some light editing of my responses. However, you can read the unedited version in its full glory below!

## My CBJ 40 Under 40 Profile

### Professional Background

* **Age:** 28
* **Education:**
  * M.S. in Information Systems Management — Washington University in St. Louis, 2020
  * B.S. in Computer Information Systems — Lindenwood University, 2018
* **Career History:**
  * Microsoft — Software Engineer, 2020-present
  * U.S. Postal Service — Software Developer, 2018-2020

### Greatest Business Accomplishment of the Past Year

I worked on several projects to support Microsoft's [Secure Future Initiative](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/11/02/advancing-microsofts-security-journey-with-our-secure-future-initiative/). This meant writing security-focused code, deploying new cloud services, retiring outdated ones, and migrating teams to more secure platforms without breaking anything or disrupting customers. Microsoft is a leader in the AI space, providing the cloud infrastructure behind [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Infrastructure) and powering AI tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot), [Microsoft Copilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Copilot), and a range of custom AI solutions for businesses around the world. That means the security work we do doesn't just affect us; it sets a higher standard for the entire industry. It may not be flashy, but it matters, especially as AI adoption keeps growing. Making sure these systems are secure and reliable is what keeps businesses and users, and I take pride in playing a part in that.

### Greatest Civic Accomplishment of the Past Year

Pulling off [Black at Microsoft Minority Student Day 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microsoft_600-students-from-28-schools-across-north-ugcPost-7196494793907048449-6Oad) was a major accomplishment—bringing together 400 students, 50 teachers, and 100 volunteers for a full day of hands-on STEM learning. One of the highlights was our workshop on [Responsible AI through Generative Music](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/stem-workshop-copilot-suno-generative-ai-music/), where students explored the ethics and creativity of AI using tools like Microsoft Copilot and Suno. It took a lot of planning, but seeing students engaged and excited about tech made it all worth it.

Another milestone was launching [Charlotte Third Places](https://www.charlottethirdplaces.com/) with 180 locations and expanding it to over 250, as businesses reached out to be included and people across the city, especially remote workers, shared how much it has helped them discover new spots. Charlotte became home for me by exploring, working from different places, and meeting people along the way. Many of these spots feel like true community hubs, where being a regular means seeing familiar faces and feeling a sense of belonging. Knowing others are using it to find those connections means a lot.

### Current Civic/Volunteer Activities

* **[Carolina Youth Coalition](https://www.carolinayouth.org/about-us)**: Volunteer writing tutor and mentor, helping under-resourced students craft college and scholarship essays. I love language, storytelling, and helping others find the words to tell their own. As a child of first-generation immigrants, I know how disorienting the college process can be without guidance. I benefited from a similar organization in high school, and it made a world of difference—so I'm enthusiastic about supporting CYC and encourage anyone in the Charlotte area to get involved. I'm also a member of their [Young Professionals Board](https://www.carolinayouth.org/yp), supporting broader access and programming initiatives.

* **[Faith, Hope & Love Mentoring](https://www.fhlmentoring.com/)**: Providing weekly after-school academic support and mentorship to K-8 students.

* **[Microsoft Charlotte Discovery Days](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7264735736778690560-71lh)**: Founder and organizer of a recurring field trip program that brings local students to Microsoft Charlotte for hands-on STEM learning, career exploration, and professional networking. Learn more [here](https://aka.ms/discovery-day/flyer).

* **[Charlotte Third Places](https://www.charlottethirdplaces.com/)**: Creator and maintainer of an open-source directory that helps Charlotte residents discover "third places"—welcoming community spaces beyond home and work. The project began as a personal list on my phone while I explored the city and worked from different spots, trying to get out of the house once things slowly reopened after the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19). Aimed at fostering connection across the city, the site features personally curated listings with details like size, Wi-Fi availability, parking situations, fun facts, and—most importantly—whether they have cinnamon rolls. Learn more about the project [here](https://www.charlottethirdplaces.com/about) and how it was built [here](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/charlotte-third-places-tech-stack/).

* **Black at Microsoft (BAM)**: Volunteer with BAM, Microsoft's employee resource group for Black employees, supporting initiatives that uplift and represent Black communities inside and outside the company. I serve on the External Connections team, representing Microsoft's Black employee community across the greater Charlotte region. I also help lead the Charlotte edition of [Minority Student Day](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/microsoft_600-students-from-28-schools-across-north-ugcPost-7196494793907048449-6Oad), contributing to event planning and curriculum design. I've also organized the Charlotte chapter of BAM's Summer Mentorship Program over the past few years—a multi-week experience where high school students learn coding, explore tech careers, and build professional skills.

### What You Like Best About Living in the Charlotte Region

Compared to other places I've lived, it's sweet out here, as in, it's a very peaceful region. The vibes are chill but not boring (to me at least), if that makes sense. Fun for most people around here is "hobbies with friends and get home at a reasonable time," and that's me 100%. Also, Charlotte is incredibly clean compared to other U.S. cities of similar size, and I love that. People care about the city, and it shows. The [parks](https://parkandrec.mecknc.gov/) and [greenways](https://parkandrec.mecknc.gov/Places-to-Visit/greenways) are amazing. Running, biking, longboarding, or just taking a long walk is easy here. And the library system, definitely underrated. Grab a book and check out the [SouthPark library's](https://www.cmlibrary.org/locations/SouthPark-Regional) upstairs patio on a warm day. It overlooks a nice fountain, has those little umbrella things for shade, good stuff.

### The Most Important Issue Facing the Region

We need reflective paint on the roads. Driving at night in the rain is wild around here. Also, I'd like to see improved public transportation. Being able to get around without a car is near and dear to my heart. I didn't have a car until I moved here, didn't need one in the previous places I lived, and I'd love to see Charlotte become that accessible. To the city's credit, there is progress with the [light rail expansion](https://www.charlottenc.gov/CATS/Transit-Planning), the [Charlotte Gateway Station](https://www.charlottenc.gov/CATS/Transit-Planning/Charlotte-Gateway-Station), and the [trolley system](https://www.charlottenc.gov/CATS/Ride/Rail/Gold-Line-Streetcar), but there's still more work to be done.

### Fun Facts

* **Most valued mentor:** My Mom.
* **Last book read:** [*East of Eden*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_Eden_(novel)), by John Steinbeck.
* **Last movie seen:** [*Atonement (2007)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonement_(2007_film)).
* **Last vacation:** Asheville, lots of tea, lots to see.
* **Favorite possession:** A red-letter Bible with deep sentimental value to me.
* **Favorite app or website:** [CharlotteThirdPlaces.com](https://www.charlottethirdplaces.com/)
* **Hobbies:** Running, longboarding, reading, writing (check out my [blog](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog)), working from third places (check out my [website](https://www.charlottethirdplaces.com/)), cinnamon-roll tourism.
* **Hero:** Jesus Christ.
* **Fantasy job:** Jedi Master during the Old Republic. Check out the [Old Republic trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb8M5P1QKX8) on YouTube. That was the coolest era to be a Jedi. I'd want a shot at influencing the Order's direction to avoid the mess that happens in the [prequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy) and [original](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy) ([the sequels don't exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/ucosbi/the_sequels_dont_exist_and_you_cant_convince_me/)) trilogies. I'd be more of an open-minded [Qui-Gon Jinn](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn) than a legalistic [Mace Windu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu), if that reference tracks.
* **One-word description of self:** [Sanguine](https://www.google.com/search?q=sanguine+meaning).

## Photo Gallery

Here are some photos from the 40 Under 40 Awards ceremony held at [The Westin Charlotte](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/cltcw-the-westin-charlotte/overview/) (which was very fancy, there's a coffee shop in the lobby with good cinnamon rolls) in May 2025.
