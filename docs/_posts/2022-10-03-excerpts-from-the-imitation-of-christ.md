*The Imitation of Christ* is a Christian devotional written by late medieval period author [Thomas à Kempis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_%C3%A0_Kempis){:target="_blank"}. It's one of the most popular Christian devotional books of all time and one that I only just recently completed. How I wish I had read it sooner!

I found myself frequently stopping to reflect on what I'd describe as profound commentaries about what it means to be a Christian. Thomas à Kempis relies on Christ's own words, and examples from his life, to highlight attitudes and behaviors we often embrace that are in total opposition to the teachings of Jesus. He does so in a refreshingly candid way. There's no window dressing, no attempts at massaging the message of Christ into something more palatable. It's direct, frank even, and incredibly thought-provoking as a result.

This post serves as a collection of passages from *The Imitation of Christ* that spoke to me the most. They're the ones that made me stop, set the book down, pick up a cup of tea and ponder for a few minutes letting it all sink in. The version I read was the [Dover Thrifts Edition](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486431851.html){:target="_blank"} which features a simple translation of the original text making it easy to understand. Enjoy!

>
> <cite>Book One, Chapter 9</cite>

> If, after being admonished once or twice, a person does not amend, do no argue with him but commit the whole matter to God that his will and honor may be furthered in all his servants, for God knows well how to turn evil to good. Try to bear patiently with the defects and infirmities of others, whatever they may be, because you also have many a fault which others must endure.
>
> <cite>Book One, Chapter 16</cite>


> If you cannot make yourself what you wish to be, how can you bend others to your will? We want them to be perfect, yet we do not correct our own faults. We wish them to be severely corrected, yet we will not correct ourselves. Their great liberty displeases us, yet we would not be denied what we ask. We would have them bound by laws, yet we will allow ourselves to be restrained in nothing. Hence, it is clear how seldom we think of others as we do ourselves.
