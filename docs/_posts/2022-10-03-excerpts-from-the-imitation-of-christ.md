## Introduction

*The Imitation of Christ* is a Christian devotional written by late medieval period author [Thomas à Kempis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_%C3%A0_Kempis). It's one of the most popular Christian books of all time and one that I only just recently completed. How I wish I had read it sooner!

I found myself frequently stopping to reflect on the book's profound commentaries about what it means to be a Christian. Thomas à Kempis relies on Christ's own words, and examples from his life, to highlight attitudes and behaviors we often embrace that are in total opposition to the teachings of Jesus. He does so in a refreshingly candid way. There's no window dressing, no attempts at massaging the message of Christ into something more palatable. It's direct, frank even, and incredibly thought-provoking as a result.

This post serves as a collection of passages from *The Imitation of Christ* that stood out to me. They're the ones that made me stop, set the book down, and ponder for a few minutes, letting it all sink in. The version I read was the [Dover Thrifts Edition](https://store.doverpublications.com/0486431851.html). It features a simple translation of the original text that made it easy to read and understand. Enjoy!

Try to bear patiently with the defects and infirmities of others, whatever they may be, because you also have many a fault which others must endure.
>
> <cite>Book One, Chapter 16</cite>


> If you cannot make yourself what you wish to be, how can you bend others to your will? We want them to be perfect, yet we do not correct our own faults. We wish them to be severely corrected, yet we will not correct ourselves. Their great liberty displeases us, yet we would not be denied what we ask. We would have them bound by laws, yet we will allow ourselves to be restrained in nothing. Hence, it is clear how seldom we think of others as we do ourselves.
