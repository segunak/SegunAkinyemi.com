This page is an ongoing list of learning resources for AI, ranging from stuff to get you started to stuff for diving deep. My goal is for this to be a targeted collection, quality over quantity. I started it for myself—a software engineer looking for ways to use AI in my workflows—and figured others might find it useful. **None of these are affiliate links.**

While being undeniably [so hot right now](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-is-so-hot-right-now), AI education [isn't exactly a novel field](https://ai100.stanford.edu/). However, the overwhelming demand for content in the space is certainly new. This list is my attempt at [separating the wheat from the <s>shaft</s> chaff 😏](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separate%20the%20wheat%20from%20the%20chaff).

**Nerd Note:** If you read the title of this article and went "What do you mean whatever Yoda was? Yoda was no mere Jedi Master, he was a Grand Master!", you're a nerd, and I love you. Yes, Yoda was a Jedi Grand Master, but it could be said he reached a level of power, influence, and status that went far beyond a title he [shared](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Master#:~:text=The%20title%20was%20shared%20by%20Jedi%20Masters%20Xo%20Lahru%2C%20Pra%2DTre%20Veter%2C%20and%20Yoda%20during%20the%20High%20Republic%20Era) with several counterparts. Yoda's [Jedi lineage is insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/16wj3w1/master_yodas_jedi_lineage_is_an_insane_thing/). He is a master of masters many generations over. The Star Wars equivalent of [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham). I believe he should have his own category, Chief Grand Master or something, especially considering his ability to remain prudent despite his infamous [ketamine addiction](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yodas-ketamine-addiction).

## Wading In

Most people have heard of AI in some way (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Firefly, Copilot, [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)), etc.), but if you want to get started with understanding what's going on under the hood, here are some good resources.

### Intro Courses

These courses walk you through the basics of AI. By basics, I mean the basics of what's happening behind the scenes, rather than the basics of using AI, such as signing up for an account to use ChatGPT. It's possible to be a decent enough AI user without understanding the concepts covered in these courses. You don't need to understand automotive engineering to drive a car, but if you want to be a better driver, understanding how your vehicle fundamentally works is undoubtedly a plus.

> **DeepLearning.AI:** [Generative AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-for-everyone)
>
This course, taught by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) is an excellent introduction to AI for anyone regardless of background. Andrew is a big deal in the AI community, like [three legendary Sannin](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Sannin) level big. As a co-founder of [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain), he played a role in building a division that went on to make many significant contributions to the field of AI. He also founded [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/about/) and co-founded [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera), the platform where you'll find his course.

### Excel + AI

There seems to be no limit to what can be done in Microsoft Excel. It is in many ways the foundation upon which the entire business world rests. The stuff people have pulled off in Excel is insane; like [this guy who built a game engine in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11osft6/i_made_a_complete_game_engine_in_excel_and_then_i/). There are companies out there whose continued existence rests on a handful of Excel spreadsheets masquerading as databases. Dread it, run from it, Excel [remains all the same](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies).

> **Ishan Anand:** [Spreadsheets Are All You Need](https://spreadsheets-are-all-you-need.ai/)
>
MIT grad [Ishan Anand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishananand/) came up with an awesome method of teaching AI using spreadsheets. His site features a series of videos that show how AI works using Excel as a familiar interface. It's a great low-code introduction to AI that's perfect for technical and non-technical audiences alike.

## Swimming Swiftly

If you're ready to go past the basics and get into building, customizing, and practically using AI, here are some resources to help you out. They aren't quite as deep as dropping everything to become a full-time AI Engineer, but they're sufficient for a tech-savvy individual to gain the knowledge needed to be dangerous.

### Prompt Engineering

The newfound field of Prompt _Engineering_ (a rather generous use of the word [engineering](https://www.mobilize.net/blog/the-misnomer-of-prompt-engineering)) can be crudely defined as "writing good instructions to get good output from AI". It's well worth understanding if you want to be an AI power user.

### Large Language Models

A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI trained on massive amounts of text data. This training enables it to understand and generate content in response to instructions (prompts). An example is OpenAI's GPT ([Generative Pre-trained Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer)), where _Generative_ highlights its ability to create new content, _Pre-trained_ indicates it has been trained on a wide array of text data, and _Transformer_ refers to the model’s architecture, designed to handle complex patterns in data efficiently. Understanding LLMs is key to moving beyond the basics and towards AI expertise.

> **Andrej Karpathy:** [Intro to Large Language Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g)
>
Andrej Karpathy is an AI heavyweight, just read through his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy) and you'll understand why. He's one of OpenAI's co-founders and—in addition to being a brilliant engineer—is an excellent educator, dropping AI knowledge for free on his YouTube channel. This 1-hour video where he introduces large language models comes highly recommended by engineers around the web. I see it linked in "How do I learn AI" threads all the time. It's certainly worth a watch!

## Diving Deep

If you're set on making AI your bread and butter, then this stuff is your jam 🙃. This is "I want to be an AI Researcher", "I want to be an AI Engineer", "I want to be a Machine Learning Engineer", and/or "I want to help advance humanity towards [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)" territory.

It's beyond what's needed for practical application. The earlier resources are sufficient for being the "AI guy" at most companies. However, if you _really_ want to know your stuff when it comes to AI—like going from the "car guy" to the "creator of novel automotive engineering advancements guy"—these resources will help.

### Foundational Texts

It might be all the rage right now, but AI isn't new. There have been several landmark works (many of them originating from researchers at Google, who deserve their flowers for advancing the field) that redefined what machines could do. To understand AI—from first principles—you need to go back and read the papers, blogs, books, etc. that laid the foundation for our present AI-crazed world. Here are a few worth reading. Remember, these resources are for diving deep, way deep. These aren't light reads.

> **Alan Turing:** [Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238)
>
Ever heard of the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)? The test for whether a machine has reached a level of intelligence indistinguishable from a human being. This paper—written by legendary mathematician and computer scientist [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)—is where it was first introduced. Published in 1950, it not only proposed the Turing Test but also delved into the possibilities and implications of what we now call artificial intelligence. Yes, this paper is old, but if you're trying to "know your stuff" when it comes to AI, reading its 28 or so pages is a must.

> **Google Brain:** [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
>
Published in [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need) by [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain), the paper _Attention Is All You Need_ introduced the [transformer model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)), laying the foundation for modern generative AI. That is, the discoveries introduced in this paper are directly responsible for OpenAI's later breakthrough with ChatGPT. This paper contains the research, the knowledge, the discoveries, that made it all possible. Its revelations shifted AI from rigid, sequence-based processing to a flexible, efficient framework capable of understanding and generating human-like text. It's a seminal read for anyone looking to understand how we got to our current state of AI-generated content being both feasible and convincing.

> **Google Research:** [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
>
  In 2018, [Google Research](https://research.google/) revolutionized the way machines understand human language with the introduction of [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This paper describes a method that allows AI to better comprehend the nuances and context of language as it's used in the real world. BERT set a new standard for natural language processing tasks, such as answering questions, translating languages, and even summarizing long articles. All of those learnings have become critical parts of major AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) If you're diving into AI, especially the language part, getting familiar with BERT is worth the time investment.

> **Stuart J. Russell & Peter Norvig:** [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
>
Do you remember when video games (excluding Madden and NBA 2K) ditched the "release a new game every year" format in favor of the "release a game and support it for years with DLCs and bug fixes" format? That's what this book is for AI. It is **the** AI textbook across universities globally and has been since its original publication in 1995. Despite its _ostensibly_ ancient publication date, it's nowhere near outdated. The authors periodically release new editions to keep with the times, each one improving on the last. The most recent edition was released in 2020 and is filled with the latest research, up-to-date examples, and insights into both the foundational theories and cutting-edge applications of AI. If you want to dive deep into AI, make this your swimming pool.

### Advanced Concepts

Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning are all important domains of artificial intelligence. Understanding what they are, and the differences between them, is key to building AI expertise. Here's an **intentionally oversimplified** rundown of those terms.

* **Machine Learning** is all about teaching computers to get smarter over time, like giving them the building blocks and basic know-how to tackle problems on their own. But you can't just kick back and let the computer do all the work—you'll still need to guide it along the way, tweaking things here and there to get the best results.
* **Neural Networks** are the engines that power many Machine Learning systems. They are designed to mimic the way the human brain operates, allowing them to learn from vast amounts of data. These networks consist of layers of interconnected parts that process data sequentially, enhancing their ability to make complex decisions and predictions.
* **Deep Learning** is like Machine Learning's overachieving sibling. It's a specific type of Machine Learning that relies heavily on Neural Networks to process massive amounts of data. Deep Learning excels at handling unstructured data like audio, video, and images. But much like Machine Learning, it still requires careful preparation and labeling of data before it can work its "magic".

This image from [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-learn-ai) does an excellent job of breaking down the terminology and their relationships.
