This page is an ongoing list of learning resources for AI, ranging from stuff to get you started to stuff for diving deep. My goal is for this to be a targeted collection, quality over quantity. I started it for myself—a software engineer looking for ways to use AI in my workflows—and figured others might find it useful. **None of these are affiliate links.**

While being undeniably [so hot right now](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/x-is-so-hot-right-now), AI education [isn't exactly a novel field](https://ai100.stanford.edu/). However, the overwhelming demand for content in the space is certainly new. This list is my attempt at [separating the wheat from the chaff](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/separate%20the%20wheat%20from%20the%20chaff).

**Nerd Note:** If you read the title of this article and went "What do you mean whatever Yoda was? Yoda was no mere Jedi Master, he was a Grand Master!", you're a nerd, and I love you. Yes, Yoda was a Jedi Grand Master, but it could be said he reached a level of power, influence, and status that went far beyond a title he [shared](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Master#:~:text=The%20title%20was%20shared%20by%20Jedi%20Masters%20Xo%20Lahru%2C%20Pra%2DTre%20Veter%2C%20and%20Yoda%20during%20the%20High%20Republic%20Era) with several counterparts. Yoda's [Jedi lineage is insane](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsCantina/comments/16wj3w1/master_yodas_jedi_lineage_is_an_insane_thing/). He is a master of masters many generations over. The Star Wars equivalent of [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham). I believe he should have his own category, Chief Grand Master or something, especially considering his ability to remain prudent despite his infamous [ketamine addiction](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yodas-ketamine-addiction).

### Intro Courses

These courses walk you through the basics of AI. By basics, I mean the basics of what's happening behind the scenes, rather than the basics of using AI, such as signing up for an account to use ChatGPT. It's possible to be a decent enough AI user without understanding the concepts covered in these courses. You don't need to understand automotive engineering to drive a car, but if you want to be a better driver, understanding how your vehicle fundamentally works is undoubtedly a plus.

> **Microsoft:** [AI Skills Navigator](https://aiskillsnavigator.microsoft.com/)

### Excel + AI

There seems to be no limit to what can be done in Microsoft Excel. It is in many ways the foundation upon which the entire business world rests. The stuff people have pulled off in Excel is insane; like [this guy who built a game engine in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11osft6/i_made_a_complete_game_engine_in_excel_and_then_i/). There are companies out there whose continued existence rests on a handful of Excel spreadsheets masquerading as databases. Dread it, run from it, Excel [remains all the same](https://www.notboring.co/p/excel-never-dies).

> **Ishan Anand:** [Spreadsheets Are All You Need](https://spreadsheets-are-all-you-need.ai/)

### Large Language Models

A large language model (LLM) is a type of AI trained on massive amounts of text data. This training enables it to understand and generate content in response to instructions (prompts). An example is OpenAI's GPT ([Generative Pre-trained Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer)), where _Generative_ highlights its ability to create new content, _Pre-trained_ indicates it has been trained on a wide array of text data, and _Transformer_ refers to the model's architecture, designed to handle complex patterns in data efficiently. Understanding LLMs is key to moving beyond the basics and towards AI expertise.

### Agentic AI

Agentic AI is the hot new thing sweeping through tech circles. Think of it as AI that doesn't just respond to your prompts but actively takes actions on your behalf. These systems can browse the web, use tools, make decisions, and accomplish complex tasks with minimal human oversight. The fundamental difference is in the action-taking capability: traditional AI models provide information or generate content when prompted, while Agentic AI actively executes tasks on behalf of users. It's the difference between "Hey AI, how do I book a flight?" and "Hey AI, book me the cheapest flight to Lagos next Tuesday."

While everyone's buzzing about it because it represents the next evolution in AI utility—from advisor to doer—let's not gloss over its serious implications. Agent systems could potentially make critical decisions with real-world consequences with little to no human supervision. We need qualified experts and proper safeguards in place before we start deploying these agents all around. It's one thing when an AI chatbot makes a factual error in a response; it's quite another when an AI agent with tool access withdraws money from your account, changes your business strategy, or modifies critical infrastructure settings.

That being said, here's some resources for learning more about Agentic AI.

> **Microsoft:** [AI Agents for Beginners](https://microsoft.github.io/ai-agents-for-beginners/)

## Diving Deep

If you're set on making AI your bread and butter, then this stuff is your jam 🙃. This is "I want to be an AI Researcher", "I want to be an AI Engineer", "I want to be a Machine Learning Engineer", and/or "I want to help advance humanity towards [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)" territory.

It's beyond what's needed for practical application. The earlier resources are sufficient for being the "AI guy" at most companies. However, if you _really_ want to know your stuff when it comes to AI—like going from the "car guy" to the "creator of novel automotive engineering advancements guy"—these resources will help.

### Foundational Texts

It might be all the rage right now, but AI isn't new. There have been several landmark works (many of them originating from researchers at Google, who deserve their flowers for advancing the field) that redefined what machines could do. To understand AI—from first principles—you need to go back and read the papers, blogs, books, etc. that laid the foundation for our present AI-crazed world. Here are a few worth reading. Remember, these resources are for diving deep, way deep. These aren't light reads.

> **Alan Turing:** [Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238)
>
Ever heard of the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test)? The test for whether a machine has reached a level of intelligence indistinguishable from a human being. This paper—written by legendary mathematician and computer scientist [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)—is where it was first introduced. Published in 1950, it not only proposed the Turing Test but also delved into the possibilities and implications of what we now call artificial intelligence. Yes, this paper is old, but if you're trying to "know your stuff" when it comes to AI, reading its 28 or so pages is a must.

>
Published in [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need) by [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain), the paper _Attention Is All You Need_ introduced the [transformer model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(deep_learning_architecture)), laying the foundation for modern generative AI. That is, the discoveries introduced in this paper are directly responsible for OpenAI's later breakthrough with ChatGPT. This paper contains the research, the knowledge, the discoveries, that made it all possible. Its revelations shifted AI from rigid, sequence-based processing to a flexible, efficient framework capable of understanding and generating human-like text. It's a seminal read for anyone looking to understand how we got to our current state of AI-generated content being both feasible and convincing.

> **Google Research:** [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
>
  In 2018, [Google Research](https://research.google/) revolutionized the way machines understand human language with the introduction of [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This paper describes a method that allows AI to better comprehend the nuances and context of language as it's used in the real world. BERT set a new standard for natural language processing tasks, such as answering questions, translating languages, and even summarizing long articles. All of those learnings have become critical parts of major AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) If you're diving into AI, especially the language part, getting familiar with BERT is worth the time investment.

Do you remember when video games (excluding Madden and NBA 2K) ditched the "release a new game every year" format in favor of the "release a game and support it for years with DLCs and bug fixes" format? That's what this book is for AI. It is **the** AI textbook across universities globally and has been since its original publication in 1995. Despite its _ostensibly_ ancient publication date, it's nowhere near outdated. The authors periodically release new editions to keep with the times, each one improving on the last. The most recent edition was released in 2020 and is filled with the latest research, up-to-date examples, and insights into both the foundational theories and cutting-edge applications of AI. If you want to dive deep into AI, make this your swimming pool.

### Advanced Concepts

Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning are all important domains of artificial intelligence. Understanding what they are, and the differences between them, is key to building AI expertise. Here's an **intentionally oversimplified** rundown of those terms.

* **Machine Learning** is all about teaching computers to get smarter over time, like giving them the building blocks and basic know-how to tackle problems on their own. But you can't just kick back and let the computer do all the work—you'll still need to guide it along the way, tweaking things here and there to get the best results.
* **Neural Networks** are the engines that power many Machine Learning systems. They are designed to mimic the way the human brain operates, allowing them to learn from vast amounts of data. These networks consist of layers of interconnected parts that process data sequentially, enhancing their ability to make complex decisions and predictions.
* **Deep Learning** is like Machine Learning's overachieving sibling. It's a specific type of Machine Learning that relies heavily on Neural Networks to process massive amounts of data. Deep Learning excels at handling unstructured data like audio, video, and images. But much like Machine Learning, it still requires careful preparation and labeling of data before it can work its "magic".

This image from [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/how-to-learn-ai) does an excellent job of breaking down the terminology and their relationships.

To thoroughly explore and understand Neural Networks, there are few better resources than this video series by [Andrej Karpathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy). He's one of OpenAI's co-founders, a former director of AI and Autopilot Vision at Tesla, and an all-around brilliant computer scientist. The YouTube playlist for the series can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ), but Andrej also has a [website](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) for the course.

> **3Blue1Brown:** [Neural Networks Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)  
>
If you're a visual learner, this is the neural networks resource for you. It was created by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), one of the most respected educational channels on YouTube, and breaks down how neural networks work with impressive visuals and animations. It's one of the most frequently recommended resources on developer forums like [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/), and for good reason. Seeing the math _come to life_ helps makes all the abstract AI concepts click. If you'd rather read than watch the videos (they're long), there's a written and interactive form of the series [here](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks).

[Michael Nielsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Nielsen), a quantum physicist and AI researcher, authored the accessible yet profound _Neural Networks and Deep Learning_ in 2015. The book is a treasure trove for anyone diving into the mechanics of Neural Networks, which are a fundamental aspect of AI. The book exists online on his website, but if you prefer, you can likely find a PDF version with a [quick search](https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Apdf+neural+networks+and+deep+learning+michael+nielsen).

#### Deep Learning

Notable learning resources for diving into Deep Learning.

> **Parand Tony Darugar:** [A Completely Non-Technical Explanation of AI and Deep Learning](https://www.parand.com/a-completely-non-technical-explanation-of-ai.html)
>
Compared to the other resources in this section, this is a lighter read. It's meant to get you familiar with the concepts behind AI and Deep Learning without the fancy terminology of academic writing. I find it refreshingly humorous while still being informative. It's a good starting place before wading into _deeper_ waters with _Deep_ Learning. [Parand Tony Dugar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parand/) has an extensive history as a tech VP and entrepreneur. His blog features other similarly written articles that make AI concepts approachable in a non-stuffy way. It's worth [checking out](https://www.parand.com/)!

If you already have coding experience and want to skip straight to practical applications of Deep Learning, this free course created by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/about.html) is a good fit. It's less "reasoning from first principles" and more "here's what to know so that you can use this right now".

## Conclusion

There's a lot of content out there related to AI. With this post, I'm trying to pare things down to what's uniquely worth spending time on. Time is precious, and now more than ever, curated content that gets to the heart of what you're looking for is needed to make the most of it. There are resources on this page that I haven't even finished combing through. I relied heavily on suggestions from prominent AI experts and tech-savvy users on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/), and [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites) while compiling this list. I'm keeping it updated as I find new resources, or conclude that existing resources aren't worth keeping listed.
