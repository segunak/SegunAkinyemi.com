## The Hype Is Real

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is far from just a buzzword these days. As a software engineer at [a company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) heavily involved in AI (in addition to their own [AI platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/organizations), they're the creators of [VS Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code), owners of [GitHub](https://github.com/features/copilot), owners of [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn), and the big tech sponsor behind [OpenAI](https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/microsoft-openai-equity-stake-nonprofit-for-profit-reorganization-sam-altman/))—I can assure you that AI's impact is very real.

I open my laptop every day to a flood of messages from colleagues, managers, and organizational leaders encouraging the use of AI tools to make us work faster, be more efficient, and most notably, write (or really, generate) code. The message is consistent across all levels: use AI tools. This isn't just a thing at [my employer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), it's a consistent theme across tech.

The AI coding revolution is not a [fad](https://www.google.com/search?q=fad+definition). There are even new terms popping up to describe it like [Natural Language Programming](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/natural-language-programming/) and [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). Companies are actively pushing employees to use these tools, doing everything to make adoption as easy and smooth as possible. And the more you use them, the more you understand why—they're [seriously good](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/). 

If you already work in tech and want to survive, or are looking to break into the field, embracing AI isn't optional, it's essential. This article is my attempt at helping you navigate this shift, based on what I'm seeing working in the industry (I'm out here tryna survive myself!).

## The State of AI in Tech

If you're entering the tech industry today without a strategy for how you'll use AI, you're putting yourself at a serious disadvantage. I promise you I'm not being dramatic. [No cap](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20cap). AI is legitimately changing how we build software, design products, analyze data, and more. It's ushered in a [whole new way of working](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/ai-a-whole-new-way-of-working).

The tools available now make tasks that once took hours take minutes. Code that would've required deep expertise in specific languages can now be generated and explained through natural language conversations. Systems that once needed teams of engineers can now be prototyped by individuals with the right AI-assisted tools. As I wrote recently, the landscape is changing rapidly:

> One thing is for sure, if we as developers don't adapt, we're more than cooked, we're royally fried. [...] No company will pass up a tool that makes developers faster and more effective. So, yes—developers will have to adapt. Some jobs will almost certainly be lost, especially among those who refuse AI-assisted development. When one developer using AI can do the work of several, fewer will be needed. That sucks, but the best way to stay ahead is to master these tools—be the expert guiding AI rather than competing with it.
>
> [GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode Is Rather Impressive, But the Real Question Is, Are Software Developers Cooked?](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/)

So, does the rise of AI mean:

* You shouldn't pursue a tech career?
* You shouldn't bother learning how to code?
* A computer science degree is suddenly worthless?
* That literally every software developer and tech worker is about to lose their job, never find work again, and society itself is doomed?

But don't take it from me, let's consult some experts.

## Reassurance From AI Pioneers

Perhaps the most compelling perspective comes from [Dr. Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng), one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence. Dr. Ng co-founded [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) (inventors of the ["T" in ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain#Transformer)), was the Chief Scientist at [Baidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu), co-founded [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera), founded [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), and served as the founding lead of the [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/). As the person who helped bring deep learning into the mainstream and educated millions through his groundbreaking [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction), his [perspective](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_deepseek-r1-uncensored-qwq-32b-puts-reasoning-activity-7305984835708141570-XVKU) on AI's impact on programming carries significant weight:

<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7305984835037118464" height="430" width="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="LinkedIn Post" style="margin-bottom:23px"></iframe>

And Dr. Ng isn't alone in this view. [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun), Meta's Chief AI Scientist and [Turing Award winner](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lecun_6017366.cfm), strongly agrees with this assessment, as seen [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_deepseek-r1-uncensored-qwq-32b-puts-reasoning-activity-7306472490199887873-7XtW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABvfe0cBF26Fjl_dkPhC1BORIN7IaP5xuKE). LeCun, who pioneered [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (the technology behind modern computer vision) and is considered one of the "godfathers of AI" alongside [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio), emphatically supports the view that AI will enhance programming rather than replace programmers.

When the very inventors and pioneers of modern AI technology are telling us that programming skills remain essential—even more valuable—in the age of AI, perhaps we should listen. Before buying into doom-and-gloom narratives about tech careers, ask yourself: who would know better about AI's true impact than the people who helped create it?

## Technical Expertise Is Still Valuable

While I'm embracing AI tools enthusiastically, I want to emphasize something crucial: a technical foundation makes these tools exponentially more powerful. This isn't just about using AI, it's about directing it with expertise.

When I work with GitHub Copilot or similar tools, I'm not passively accepting what they generate. I'm actively validating output, spotting edge cases the AI missed, and making design and architecture decisions that require true human intuition. You can let AI suggest options, but you're the one who understands what you're actually building—the ethical implications, the various contexts and trade-offs, the budget constraints. You don't need to exhaustively explain these to AI; instead, have it build what you already know needs to be done. 

My time invested in learning programming fundamentals, [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), and [system architecture](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) allows me to:

1. **Guide AI toward appropriate solutions** - I can instruct AI using technical concepts lie "We'll need to normalize this database schema," or "Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions," or any other scenario where actually knowing what you're talking about gives you the ability to quickly iterate with AI.

2. **Validate AI-generated code** - My coding knowledge helps me spot when AI generates suboptimal solutions or misses edge cases. I can also identify when code technically "works" but isn't suitable for the larger system I'm building. Enterprise software development involves many considerations beyond simply choosing your favorite programming language. I'm not blindly trusting the output (although depending on your project's criticality, you might be able to, hence the term [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)), but rather reviewing it with technical expertise.

3. **Make architectural decisions** - AI can't (and shouldn't) independently decide if your system needs a microservices architecture or a monolith (ew), or whether to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) versus [REST](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/). Other critical decisions AI shouldn't make alone include:
  - Database selection ([SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.timescale.com/blog/why-sql-beating-nosql-what-this-means-for-future-of-data-time-series-database-348b777b847a), specific vendors, or using [Postgres for everything](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33934139))
  - Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, session-based)
  - Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory, CDN)
  - Deployment architecture (containers, serverless, VMs)
  - State management approaches
  
As IBM famously stated in 1979: "A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision." This principle is even more relevant in the age of AI. While these tools can analyze options and generate recommendations, the final architectural decisions must remain with humans who can be held accountable for the outcomes. These decisions affect users, businesses, and sometimes entire countries. No matter how sophisticated AI becomes, responsibility and accountability must stay with the engineers and architects who understand the broader context, ethical implications, and business requirements that AI alone cannot fully comprehend.

So if you're looking to enter tech or grow in it, here's my advice: invest in your technical foundation first. You don't need to learn every language, but you should:

1. **Learn at least one programming language** - I recommend Python as it's both beginner-friendly and [powerful enough for AI development](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Resources I recommend:
   - [Harvard's CS50 Python Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)
   - [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)

2. **Learn core computer science concepts** - Having a basic understanding (you don't need to be a [LeetCode wizard](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/), the basics will do) data structures, algorithms, and system design will help you guide AI effectively:
   - [Google's Data Structures & Algorithms Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)
   - [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Apdf+Grokking+Algorithms+by+Aditya+Y+Bhargava)
   - [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

3. **Study software & cloud architecture patterns** - These fundamentals haven't changed with AI:
   - [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
   - [Clean Architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Apdf+Clean+Architecture+by+Robert+C.+Martin)
   - [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/)
   - [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/)

## How I'm Adapting (And You Can Too)

Assuming you've built a solid technical foundation (which doesn't necessarily mean coding—it could be any knowledge worker skills like data analysis, project management, or design), here's how I'm navigating the AI revolution in my career, which I hope gives you some insights into how you might want to as well.

1. **Use AI tools to do the boring stuff** - I let AI handle repetitive coding tasks while I focus on more challenging parts like architecture and business logic. The better you understand coding fundamentals, the better you can use these tools effectively.

2. **Understand systems, not just syntax** - AI can help write code, but you need to understand how all the pieces fit together. Resources like the [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) and the [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) are helpful here.

3. **Learn to write good prompts** - Being clear and specific when talking to AI tools makes a huge difference. I put as much thought into my prompts as I do my code. Check out the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide) and OpenAI's [Prompt Engineering Strategies](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).

4. **Try more stuff** - With AI handling implementation details, I can explore more frameworks and languages. I don't need to be an expert to build something useful with technologies I'm less familiar with. However, I try to ensure I understand enough to validate the AI's output. That's crucial, if you're completely lost without AI assistance, you're not using it effectively.

5. **Get better at systems and architecture design** - While AI excels at generating code, designing robust systems remains our responsibility (especially as you advance in your career, where impact comes more from architecture than coding). I'm deliberately investing extended time in learning distributed systems, cloud architecture patterns, and scalable design principles. As AI handles more implementation details, your ability to architect cohesive, maintainable systems becomes a most valuable skill.

Remember: AI is ultimately a tool. Its value is a function of how you're using it. Two people can take the same math test, with the same calculator, and yet one fails and one passes. You've got to know how to use your calculator, what calculations to put in there, you've got to understand the problems on the worksheet. It's not enough to have the calculator, you've got to know how to best use it. The best tech workers aren't going to be those who rely on AI in such a way that they're bringing nothing of value to the table, it's the ones who know how to direct it effectively because they actually know what they're doing.

## AI Tools for Tech Professionals

These tools integrate AI directly into your workflow. Instead of context-switching to ChatGPT or other standalone AI interfaces, they bring intelligence right into the applications you already use.

This is the most significant shift I've observed: AI isn't just a separate chatbot anymore. It's embedded within your existing tools, enhancing productivity without disrupting your workflow. When used correctly, this integration dramatically improves efficiency.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Having spent time at career fairs and hosting student field trips at [my employer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) offices, I get asked these questions a lot. Here are my honest answers:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Is AI going to replace all software developers?</summary>

No, but it will replace developers who refuse to adapt to using AI. Look at history: calculators didn't replace mathematicians, CAD software didn't replace architects, and Excel didn't replace accountants. These tools changed how the work is done, making professionals who embraced them more valuable. I do think we'll probably end up with less developers overall though, as it'll be easier for less people to do more because AI is doing so much of the grunt work.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Should I even bother learning to code with AI around?</summary>

Absolutely yes. Don't just listen to me on this one though, scroll back up to [this section](#reassurance-from-ai-pioneers). People far smarter than me have spoken on this. Also, check out the article [Is Coding Education As We Know It Dead?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishatalagala/2023/06/01/is-coding-educationas-we-know-itdead-how-large-language-models-are-changing-programmers/)
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Is using AI tools 'cheating' or making me less skilled?</summary>

No more than using Stack Overflow, libraries, or frameworks is cheating. At [my employer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), we're actively encouraged to use AI tools to be more productive. The goal is solving problems and creating value, not proving you can remember syntax.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Is a computer science degree still worth it?</summary>

Yes, with a caveat: make sure your program is adapting to include AI. A good CS degree teaches fundamentals that remain valuable regardless of tools:

- Algorithms and data structures
- System design principles
- Problem-solving approaches
- Software architecture patterns
- Computer science theory

That said, supplement your degree with practical AI skills. Check out [Microsoft's AI Skills Navigator](https://aiskillsnavigator.microsoft.com/en-us).

Also, consider the financial aspect. If pursuing a CS degree means accumulating massive debt, carefully weigh your options. Many successful tech professionals enter the field through community colleges, bootcamps, or certificate programs. Tech is uniquely meritocratic; four years of traditional education isn't always necessary before you can contribute meaningfully to the industry. Self-taught developers with strong portfolios and practical skills often compete successfully against degree holders, especially when they demonstrate AI proficiency. **But to be clear, if you can go to college without going into massive debt, I think you should**. The path for those who don't is doable, but harder.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ How do I compete with AI in tech?</summary>

You don't compete with AI, you use it. Or "leverage it" if I wanted to sound like a business person. Focus on these skills that AI enhances rather than replaces:

**1. Technical System Design & Architecture**
* Learn [system design fundamentals](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) and how to architect scalable systems.
* Master [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) to solve common engineering problems.
* Study [clean architecture principles](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) for building maintainable software.
* Take free courses on [cloud architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) from major providers.

**2. Domain Expertise & Business Acumen**
* Develop [deep knowledge](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) of the industry you're building for. This includes looking for a job at a company providing a product or service that you actually like. For example, you love basketball, but aren't that good at it, so instead of becoming a baller, you get a tech job working on stuff for the NBA. Since you actually love the core business, it's easy to marry that with tech expertise. You're not just technical, you understand how things fit into the business, why they're valuable, what people are looking for. With AI, thinking this way matters more than ever. You can't just be a code mercenary hopping from company to company with no understanding of who you're building for and why it matters. You've got to dive deep into a domain so that your value goes beyond just writing code, because AI can do that for us now.
* Learn [how to translate business requirements](https://www.coursera.org/articles/business-analyst) into technical solutions. Seriously. Think about what AI tools need to be the most valuable. Clearly defined requirements, parameters, contextual knowledge. The better you are at this, the better you'll be able to "prompt engineer".
* Follow industry leaders on [platforms like LinkedIn](https://www.getphyllo.com/post/ai-influencers-linkedin) to stay current in your field.
* Take career-path-specific courses on [platforms like Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/career-paths/).

**3. Communication & Collaboration**
- Improve [technical writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) skills so that you can write the kind of documenation abotu the very nicehh and specific things you're building or your company is working on that can be fed to AI to help it do the busy work while you focus on the bigger picture.
- Develop [prompt engineering skills](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) to get better results from AI. Check out the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide).
- Enhance [soft skills](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=soft%20skills) that make people want you on their team. Seriously. I've been surprised how much of success in tech is about people actually liking working with you rather than technical acumen alone. With AI, I'd imagine this will trend will only increase.

**4. Security & Best Practices**
- Learn [cybersecurity fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity) to keep systems safe. With the rise of AI, companies [care about this now more than ever](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative).
- Study [secure coding practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/stable-en/) to protect applications being created with AI generated code. Humans who can help keep all of us safe from AI making mistakes (which it does) because they know what secure code and systems look like will remain valuable.
- Understand [AI security challenges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) and ethical implications. You don't even have to work in tech, go become a lawyer and help regulate big tech usage of AI so we don't end up with [Skynet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)).
- Explore [cybersecurity career paths](https://www.coursera.org/articles/cybersecurity-career-paths) as demand for experts in this field grows. Organizations want people watching AI, protecting their systems from hackers using AI, from customers trying to do inappropriate stuff with AI, from AI systems that have gone rogue, cybersecurity isn't going anywhere.

**5. User Experience & Human-Centered Design**
- Study [UX design principles](https://blog.uxtweak.com/best-ux-resources/) so that you're able to properly guide AI with your prompting in creating websites or apps or dashboards or whatever that peopl eactually enjoy using.
- Take courses on [human-computer interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses) to understand user behavior.
- Learn [accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) so that when you're generating code with AI you can do so with prompts that keep  inclusive design in mind. Be the human making sure this thing is building for all humans ot be able to use and beenfit from things.

**6. Project Management & Execution**
- Learn [agile methodologies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) as humans working on teams together in this manner hasn't been changed by AI. All this stuffis still around, as annoying as it can be, it has more to do with how we work with each other rather than AI building software.
- Master [user story creation](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) as AI increasingly implements them
- Study [technical program management](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/technical-program-management-foundations) to coordinate complex initiatives
- Explore tools like [GitHub's Project Padawan](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/#project-padawan-swe-agents-on-github) for AI-assisted development where you literally assign user stories to an AI agent, it does all the work, and you just loop back for a pull request review (that is insane I can't believe i just typed that.)

As AI handles more coding tasks, your value comes from combining technical knowledge with distinctly human skills—judgment, creativity, interpersonal communication, and business understanding. These are areas where humans working with AI will move things along faster  than AI working alone (for now at least, only God knows the future).

## Closing Words

I wrote this article because I'm tired of seeing talented people hesitate to pursue tech careers due to AI anxiety. Yes, the landscape is changing dramatically—I see it firsthand at [a company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) heavily invested in this future. But change brings opportunity. The key is to be proactive rather than reactive.

Writing this was also a learning exercise for me. As [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (or maybe [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), the internet [can't seem to agree](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/02/27/teach/)) said: "_The best way to learn is to teach_". By breaking down what I'm seeing in the industry and sharing it with you, I'm forced to really understand it myself.

So whether you're:
- A student wondering if tech is still worth pursuing (it is)
- A developer worried about job security (adapt!)
- Someone in an adjacent field curious about the AI revolution (join us!)

I hope this article gave you some clarity and practical next steps.

The future of tech careers isn't about competing with AI—it's about knowing how to wield it effectively. And trust me, we're just getting started. 

Stay curious, keep learning, and don't forget to [shine your eyes](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shine%20your%20eyes).
