## The Hype Is Real

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is far from just a buzzword these days. As a software engineer at [a company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) heavily involved in AI (in addition to their own [AI platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/organizations), they're the creators of [VS Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code), owners of [GitHub](https://github.com/features/copilot), owners of [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn), and the big tech sponsor behind [OpenAI](https://fortune.com/2024/10/18/microsoft-openai-equity-stake-nonprofit-for-profit-reorganization-sam-altman/))—I can assure you that AI's impact is very real.

I open my laptop every day to a flood of messages from colleagues, managers, and organizational leaders encouraging the use of AI tools to make us work faster, be more efficient, and most notably, write (or really, generate) code. The message is consistent across all levels: use AI tools. This isn't just a thing at [my employer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), it's a consistent theme across tech.

The AI coding revolution is not a [fad](https://www.google.com/search?q=fad+definition). There are even new terms popping up to describe it like [Natural Language Programming](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/natural-language-programming/) and [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). Companies are actively pushing employees to use these tools, doing everything to make adoption as easy and smooth as possible. And the more you use them, the more you understand why—they're [seriously good](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/). 

If you already work in tech and want to survive, or are looking to break into the field, embracing AI isn't optional, it's essential. This article is my attempt at helping you navigate this shift, based on what I'm seeing working in the industry (I'm out here tryna survive myself!).

## The State of AI in Tech

If you're entering the tech industry today without a strategy for how you'll use AI, you're putting yourself at a serious disadvantage. I promise you I'm not being dramatic. [No cap](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=no%20cap). AI is legitimately changing how we build software, design products, analyze data, and more. It's ushered in a [whole new way of working](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/ai-a-whole-new-way-of-working).

The tools available now make tasks that once took hours take minutes. Code that would've required deep expertise in specific languages can now be generated and explained through natural language conversations. Systems that once needed teams of engineers can now be prototyped by individuals with the right AI-assisted tools. As I wrote recently, the landscape is changing rapidly:

> One thing is for sure, if we as developers don't adapt, we're more than cooked, we're royally fried. [...] No company will pass up a tool that makes developers faster and more effective. So, yes—developers will have to adapt. Some jobs will almost certainly be lost, especially among those who refuse AI-assisted development. When one developer using AI can do the work of several, fewer will be needed. That sucks, but the best way to stay ahead is to master these tools—be the expert guiding AI rather than competing with it.
>
> [GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode Is Rather Impressive, But the Real Question Is, Are Software Developers Cooked?](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/github-copilot-agent-mode/)

So, does the rise of AI mean:

* You shouldn't pursue a tech career?
* You shouldn't bother learning how to code?
* A computer science degree is suddenly worthless?
* That literally every software developer and tech worker is about to lose their job, never find work again, and society itself is doomed?

But don't take it from me, let's consult some experts.

## Reassurance From AI Pioneers

Perhaps the most compelling perspective comes from [Dr. Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng), one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence. Dr. Ng co-founded [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) (inventors of the ["T" in ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain#Transformer)), was the Chief Scientist at [Baidu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu), co-founded [Coursera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera), founded [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/), and served as the founding lead of the [Stanford AI Lab](https://ai.stanford.edu/). As the person who helped bring deep learning into the mainstream and educated millions through his groundbreaking [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction), his [perspective](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_deepseek-r1-uncensored-qwq-32b-puts-reasoning-activity-7305984835708141570-XVKU) on AI's impact on programming carries significant weight:

<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7305984835037118464" height="430" width="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="LinkedIn Post" style="margin-bottom:23px"></iframe>

And Dr. Ng isn't alone in this view. [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun), Meta's Chief AI Scientist and [Turing Award winner](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lecun_6017366.cfm), strongly agrees with this assessment, as seen [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_deepseek-r1-uncensored-qwq-32b-puts-reasoning-activity-7306472490199887873-7XtW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABvfe0cBF26Fjl_dkPhC1BORIN7IaP5xuKE). LeCun, who pioneered [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (the technology behind modern computer vision) and is considered one of the "godfathers of AI" alongside [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton) and [Yoshua Bengio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio), emphatically supports the view that AI will enhance programming rather than replace programmers.

When the very inventors and pioneers of modern AI technology are telling us that programming skills remain essential—even more valuable—in the age of AI, perhaps we should listen. Before buying into doom-and-gloom narratives about tech careers, ask yourself: who would know better about AI's true impact than the people who helped create it?

## Technical Expertise Is Still Valuable

While I'm embracing AI tools enthusiastically, I want to emphasize something crucial: a technical foundation makes these tools exponentially more powerful. This isn't just about using AI, it's about directing it with expertise.

When I work with GitHub Copilot or similar tools, I'm not passively accepting what they generate. I'm actively validating output, spotting edge cases the AI missed, and making design and architecture decisions that require true human intuition. You can let AI suggest options, but you're the one who understands what you're actually building—the ethical implications, the various contexts and trade-offs, the budget constraints. You don't need to exhaustively explain these to AI; instead, have it build what you already know needs to be done. 

My time invested in learning programming fundamentals, [design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), and [system architecture](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) allows me to:

1. **Guide AI toward appropriate solutions** - I can instruct AI using technical concepts lie "We'll need to normalize this database schema," or "Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions," or any other scenario where actually knowing what you're talking about gives you the ability to quickly iterate with AI.

2. **Validate AI-generated code** - My coding knowledge helps me spot when AI generates suboptimal solutions or misses edge cases. I can also identify when code technically "works" but isn't suitable for the larger system I'm building. Enterprise software development involves many considerations beyond simply choosing your favorite programming language. I'm not blindly trusting the output (although depending on your project's criticality, you might be able to, hence the term [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding)), but rather reviewing it with technical expertise.

3. **Make architectural decisions** - AI can't (and shouldn't) independently decide if your system needs a microservices architecture or a monolith (ew), or whether to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) versus [REST](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/). Other critical decisions AI shouldn't make alone include:
  - Database selection ([SQL vs NoSQL](https://www.timescale.com/blog/why-sql-beating-nosql-what-this-means-for-future-of-data-time-series-database-348b777b847a), specific vendors, or using [Postgres for everything](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33934139))
  - Authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT, session-based)
  - Caching strategies (Redis, in-memory, CDN)
  - Deployment architecture (containers, serverless, VMs)
  - State management approaches
  
As IBM famously stated in 1979: "A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision." This principle is even more relevant in the age of AI. While these tools can analyze options and generate recommendations, the final architectural decisions must remain with humans who can be held accountable for the outcomes. These decisions affect users, businesses, and sometimes entire countries. No matter how sophisticated AI becomes, responsibility and accountability must stay with the engineers and architects who understand the broader context, ethical implications, and business requirements that AI alone cannot fully comprehend.

So if you're looking to enter tech or grow in it, here's my advice: invest in your technical foundation first. You don't need to learn every language, but you should:

1. **Learn at least one programming language** - I recommend Python as it's both beginner-friendly and [powerful enough for AI development](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Resources I recommend:
   - [Harvard's CS50 Python Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)
   - [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)

2. **Learn core computer science concepts** - Having a basic understanding (you don't need to be a [LeetCode wizard](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/), the basics will do) data structures, algorithms, and system design will help you guide AI effectively:
   - [Google's Data Structures & Algorithms Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)
   - [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Apdf+Grokking+Algorithms+by+Aditya+Y+Bhargava)
   - [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)

3. **Study software & cloud architecture patterns** - These fundamentals haven't changed with AI:
   - [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
   - [Clean Architecture](https://www.google.com/search?q=filetype%3Apdf+Clean+Architecture+by+Robert+C.+Martin)
   - [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/)
   - [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/)

## How I'm Adapting (And You Can Too)

Assuming you've built a solid technical foundation (which doesn't necessarily mean coding—it could be any knowledge worker skills like data analysis, project management, or design), here's how I'm navigating the AI revolution in my career, which I hope gives you some insights into how you might want to as well.

1. **Use AI tools to do the boring stuff** - I let AI handle repetitive coding tasks while I focus on more challenging parts like architecture and business logic. The better you understand coding fundamentals, the better you can use these tools effectively.

2. **Understand systems, not just syntax** - AI can help write code, but you need to understand how all the pieces fit together. Resources like the [Azure Architecture Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/) and the [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/) are helpful here.

3. **Learn to write good prompts** - Being clear and specific when talking to AI tools makes a huge difference. I put as much thought into my prompts as I do my code. Check out the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide) and OpenAI's [Prompt Engineering Strategies](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).

4. **Try more stuff** - With AI handling implementation details, I can explore more frameworks and languages. I don't need to be an expert to build something useful with technologies I'm less familiar with. However, I try to ensure I understand enough to validate the AI's output. That's crucial, if you're completely lost without AI assistance, you're not using it effectively.

5. **Get better at systems and architecture design** - While AI excels at generating code, designing robust systems remains our responsibility (especially as you advance in your career, where impact comes more from architecture than coding). I'm deliberately investing extended time in learning distributed systems, cloud architecture patterns, and scalable design principles. As AI handles more implementation details, your ability to architect cohesive, maintainable systems becomes a most valuable skill.

Remember: AI is ultimately a tool. Its value is a function of how you're using it. Two people can take the same math test, with the same calculator, and yet one fails and one passes. You've got to know how to use your calculator, what calculations to put in there, you've got to understand the problems on the worksheet. It's not enough to have the calculator, you've got to know how to best use it. The best tech workers aren't going to be those who rely on AI in such a way that they're bringing nothing of value to the table, it's the ones who know how to direct it effectively because they actually know what they're doing.

## AI Tools for Tech Professionals

These tools integrate AI directly into your workflow. Instead of context-switching to ChatGPT or other standalone AI interfaces, they bring intelligence right into the applications you already use.

This is the most significant shift I've observed: AI isn't just a separate chatbot anymore. It's embedded within your existing tools, enhancing productivity without disrupting your workflow. When used correctly, this integration dramatically improves efficiency.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Having spent time at career fairs and hosting student field trips at [my employer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) offices, I get asked these questions a lot. Here are my honest answers:

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Is AI going to replace all software developers?</summary>

No, but it will replace developers who refuse to adapt to using AI. Look at history: calculators didn't replace mathematicians, CAD software didn't replace architects, and Excel didn't replace accountants. These tools changed how the work is done, making professionals who embraced them more valuable. I do think we'll probably end up with less developers overall though, as it'll be easier for less people to do more because AI is doing so much of the grunt work.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Should I even bother learning to code with AI around?</summary>

Absolutely yes. Don't just listen to me on this one though, scroll back up to [this section](#reassurance-from-ai-pioneers). People far smarter than me have spoken on this. Also, check out the article [Is Coding Education As We Know It Dead?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nishatalagala/2023/06/01/is-coding-educationas-we-know-itdead-how-large-language-models-are-changing-programmers/)
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Is using AI tools 'cheating' or making me less skilled?</summary>

No more than using Stack Overflow, libraries, or frameworks is cheating. At [my employer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), we're actively encouraged to use AI tools to be more productive. The goal is solving problems and creating value, not proving you can remember syntax.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ Is a computer science degree still worth it?</summary>

Yes, with a caveat: make sure your program is adapting to include AI. A good CS degree teaches fundamentals that remain valuable regardless of tools:

- Algorithms and data structures
- System design principles
- Problem-solving approaches
- Software architecture patterns
- Computer science theory

That said, supplement your degree with practical AI skills. Check out [Microsoft's AI Skills Navigator](https://aiskillsnavigator.microsoft.com/en-us).

Also, consider the financial aspect. If pursuing a CS degree means accumulating massive debt, carefully weigh your options. Many successful tech professionals enter the field through community colleges, bootcamps, or certificate programs. Tech is uniquely meritocratic; four years of traditional education isn't always necessary before you can contribute meaningfully to the industry. Self-taught developers with strong portfolios and practical skills often compete successfully against degree holders, especially when they demonstrate AI proficiency. **But to be clear, if you can go to college without going into massive debt, I think you should**. The path for those who don't is doable, but harder.
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ How do I compete with AI in tech?</summary>

You don't compete with AI, you use it. Or "leverage it" if I wanted to sound like a business person. Focus on skills that AI enhances rather than replaces:

1. [System architecture and design](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) - Understanding how to design scalable, maintainable systems remains a critical human skill.

2. Business domain knowledge - Developers who deeply understand the products and industries they're building for will always be valuable. AI can write code, but it can't replace [industry expertise](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) or contextual understanding of business problems.

3. [Problem analysis and solution design](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) - Breaking down complex requirements and designing appropriate solutions requires human judgment and creativity.

4. Team collaboration and communication - AI tools can't replace the [soft skills](https://www.coursera.org/articles/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills) needed to work effectively within a team. I've been surprised by how much career advancement in tech depends on people wanting you on their projects and teams. It isn't coding alone in a dark basement, it's deeply collaborative. Strong interpersonal skills directly impact your promotion opportunities, while poor collaboration will limit your career growth.

5. Technical writing and communication - The ability to write clear, precise instructions is invaluable when working with AI. This is the essence of prompt engineering. The quality of AI output directly correlates with the quality of your prompts. In many ways, the new form of coding is writing really well in natural language, what some call [Natural Language Programming](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/natural-language-programming/). Developers who can articulate requirements, constraints, and goals with precision will get significantly better results from AI tools than those who can't.

6. Security and best practices - Cybersecurity requires deep expertise that AI can enhance but not replace. Organizations need security professionals who use AI to strengthen their work, as no one wants AI alone responsible for protecting critical systems. With growing demand for security expertise, [cybersecurity career paths](https://www.coursera.org/articles/cybersecurity-career-paths) remain promising.

7. [Ethical decision-making and AI governance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) - Understanding the ethical implications of AI systems and establishing proper governance frameworks is becoming essential.

8. User experience (UX) understanding - Knowing how humans interact with technology remains crucial. Check out a list of UX learning resources [here](https://blog.uxtweak.com/best-ux-resources/).

9. Project management and prioritization - GitHub is developing features like [Project Padawan](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/#project-padawan-swe-agents-on-github) where you can assign AI work items on repositories and receive pull requests to review. This makes well-written, detailed user stories even more crucial. Learn more with [Atlassian's guide to user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories).
</details>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>❓ What's the best way to start learning AI coding tools?</summary>

1. **Use GitHub Copilot** - This is the most widely-adopted AI coding assistant that integrates directly into VS Code. With Microsoft's backing and OpenAI partnership, it's becoming the industry standard employers expect you to know. [Get started here](https://github.com/features/copilot).

2. **Learn prompt engineering** - Writing effective prompts is becoming as valuable as coding itself. Practice crafting clear, specific instructions that yield better results. Check out [OpenAI's prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).

3. **Use structured learning resources**:
   - [Microsoft's AI Skills Navigator](https://aiskillsnavigator.microsoft.com/en-us) - A comprehensive roadmap to build AI skills with personalized learning paths
   - [Google's AI Training Hub](https://grow.google/ai/) - Free courses and resources to help you develop practical AI skills

4. **Join AI communities** - Places like [r/ChatGPTCoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/) let you learn from others' experiences and stay updated on new techniques.

5. **Practice consistently** - Like any skill, improving with AI tools requires regular use. Try incorporating them into small personal projects first.

## Closing Words

I wrote this article because I'm tired of seeing talented people hesitate to pursue tech careers due to AI anxiety. Yes, the landscape is changing dramatically—I see it firsthand at [a company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) heavily invested in this future. But change brings opportunity. The key is to be proactive rather than reactive.

Writing this was also a learning exercise for me. As [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) (or maybe [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), the internet [can't seem to agree](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/02/27/teach/)) said: "_The best way to learn is to teach_". By breaking down what I'm seeing in the industry and sharing it with you, I'm forced to really understand it myself.

So whether you're:
- A student wondering if tech is still worth pursuing (it is)
- A developer worried about job security (adapt!)
- Someone in an adjacent field curious about the AI revolution (join us!)

I hope this article gave you some clarity and practical next steps.

The future of tech careers isn't about competing with AI—it's about knowing how to wield it effectively. And trust me, we're just getting started. 

Stay curious, keep learning, and don't forget to [shine your eyes](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shine%20your%20eyes).
