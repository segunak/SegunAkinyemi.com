Welcome! This page highlights various [stuff and thangs](https://www.google.com/search?q=stuff+and+thangs+rick+grimes+the+walking+dead) I've been working on or involved in. I try to keep it updated, so it's a good place to check in if you're curious about what I've been up to.

## Ongoing Stuff

- **[Discovery Days](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7264735736778690560-71lh):** A recurring field trip program I founded in 2022 that brings local students to Microsoft Charlotte for hands-on STEM learning and career exploration, [learn more here](https://aka.ms/discovery-day/flyer).

- **[Charlotte Third Places](https://charlottethirdplaces.com/):** An open-source directory that helps Charlotte residents discover "third places", which are welcoming community spaces beyond home and work. The project began as a personal list on my phone while I explored the city and worked from different spots, and features personally curated listings with details like size, Wi-Fi availability, parking situations, fun facts, and most importantly, whether they have [cinnamon rolls](https://segunakinyemi.com/tags/#dough-diaries).

- **[Carolina Youth Coalition](https://www.carolinayouth.org/):** I serve on their [Young Professionals Board](https://www.carolinayouth.org/yp) and volunteer as a writing coach helping students craft college essays and win scholarships. I also mentor students interested in tech careers. Working directly with students gives me unfiltered feedback on how CYC impacts their lives, and it's all positive. I've watched first-generation kids like me go from nothing to college degrees and careers that transform their families. CYC changes lives, and I encourage everyone to [get involved](https://www.carolinayouth.org/join-us)!
