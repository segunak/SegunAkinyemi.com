## Background & Education

Hello there, I'm Segun Akinyemi—pronounced _sheh-goon ah-keen-yeh-mee_—a [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) name that is, in truth, much longer (if you ever run into me, ask me my full name). Welcome to my website, a place where I share my various passions and interests.

For some background about me, I grew up in [Seattle, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), but after high school, I made my way to the [Midwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States) to attend [Lindenwood University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenwood_University) in [St. Charles, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles,_Missouri), a suburb of [St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis). If you're wondering how I ended up there, I'll admit I didn't exactly choose Lindenwood out of a sea of options. The athletic scholarship they offered me made college just barely affordable. During my time there, I competed as a track & field athlete in the high jump while studying Computer Information Systems, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 2018. Looking back, I truly believe my time at Lindenwood was [divinely ordained](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+16%3A9&version=NIV). It wasn't perfect by any means, but it was perfect for me at that time in my life, and I'm grateful for the experience. Shortly thereafter, I continued my education at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis), earning a Master of Science in Information Systems Management in 2020.

## Personal Journey

I often tell people that while I was raised in the greater Seattle area, I [became a man](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013%3A11&version=NKJV) in St. Louis. People who mean a lot to me reside there—people who didn't just preach the Gospel, they lived it. They picked me up when I was down, offered essentials while I was a broke college student, opened their homes during holidays when I couldn't afford to fly back, and housed me over summers so I could work odd jobs to support my family. They helped me pay off a [Sallie Mae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallie_Mae) (a truly evil and predatory organization) loan so I could stay in school—ensuring that by graduation, I owed them nothing. They stood in the crowds at my track meets, wrote references for internships and grad school, insisted on sending money to my family when I finally opened up about our needs, and sat with me in church pews, long after service had ended, in [vigil](https://www.gotquestions.org/prayer-vigil.html), praying for God's grace, deliverance, and aid when I needed it most. It was through these people that I experienced Jesus—not in a [whirlwind from heaven](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+38%3A1&version=KJV)—but in everyday acts of love and sacrifice.

Those experiences transformed my understanding of what it means to be a Christian. As is written, [*"If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?"*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A15-17&version=NIV). The generosity I've received is why I'm so passionate about [service](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A27&version=NKJV). I do for others what God did for me—through people who didn't just talk about being Christians—they lived it. Or, to put it another way, they were [bout that action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6xTB6xnLik). If the world were ending tomorrow, without hesitation, I'd be on my way *home* to St. Louis, Missouri. It was the Midwestern kindness of people in the ["Show-Me" State](https://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/history/slogan.asp) that helped me find myself and become who I am today.

## Professional Life & Values

Now as a working professional, I'm a software engineer, but I like to style myself more broadly as a tech enthusiast. I'm fascinated by technology and its ability to transform the world around us. I consider myself fortunate to have been born in our present era of computing innovation, problem-solving, and discovery. At the rate we're advancing, it seems like [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) might just need an update. If you're wondering what I'm up to career-wise, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/segunakinyemi), or check out my [Charlotte Business Journal 40 Under 40 profile](https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/cbj-40-under-40/).

Regarding my personal convictions, I strive to live in a way that emulates the character of [Jesus Christ](/blog/commands-of-christ/). His teachings guide my life, my definition of who I am, and my understanding of what's truly important. I could speak at length on this topic, but this page is meant to be only a brief introduction, so I'll refrain. Instead, I leave you with one of my [favorite quotes](/blog/favorite-quotes) below.

> Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in heaven.

> <cite>Matthew 5:16</cite>

All that being said, thanks for visiting. Feel free to explore!
