## A Brief Background

BEfore we all turned to social media to be our be all end all for news, enteremiianment, sports, media, polticis, religion, food, and everhting in between, the Internet used to be dominated by blogs. indivudal people out there just blogging, sharing thier insights, telling their story. Most of them used Word Press. Those sorts of blogs still exist, but there's way less readers, because it's just easier to follow people on social emdia then commit hte attention span to reading anything that takes more than 10 seconds (i don't view that as a good thing, just a reality.) Our attention spans as a society are [undoubtedly shrinking under the influence of social media](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385214649_This_is_Your_Brain_on_Social_Media_How_Social_Media_Use_is_Changing_our_Attention_Spans).

Back in thos blog days, you'd find a post called something like "How to cook macorni and cheese" and it'd be some lady who felt the need to give you an entire Hallmark movie script before getting to the point where she tells you how to cook the one thing that led you to click.

I'm not going to do that to you. IF you want t oread my story with cinnamon rolls, my journey, my heart's cery for them, you can click here. If you want my top three in the charlotte area, inclduing some honorable mentons, and spots outside of Charlotte, youcan click here.

Aside from that, here'os waht you came for.

## Where to Find Cinnamon Rolls in Charlotte

This section isn't about me. It's about connecting **you** with knowledge. Here are places in the greater Charltote area that sell cinnamon rolls. I have strong opinonos, in fact strong is an understamenet. I have **overhwlemginly detailed and emotioanlly charged** opinions about the spots here I've gotten to try (some I haven't...yet). But to get those, you'll need to scroll on, or [contact me](/contact). If you want to talk about cinnmaon rolls, my door is always open. If you're reading this and know me in real life, you can stop me at any time, in any conversation, to talk about cinnamon rolls (or Jesus) and I will never be upset with you. I couldn't be, even if I tried.

(THIS IS WHERE I PUT A WIDGET/DYNAMIC THIGN THAT DEFAULTS TO A MAP of the plotted places but has two tabs, map view and list view)


## The Top Three

I have a philosophy when it comes to rankings. You give people your top three, and an honorable mention. Beyond that, comparisons get murky. Different styles, different strengths, different techniques. Rather than stress myself out with [Keith Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Lee_(food_critic)) style metrics, I keep it simple. Top three, and an honorable mention. Nothing more, nothing less. I keep these rankings updated. This is less a blog post and more of a public journal entry of my cinnamon roll adventuresa nd experiencse in teh greater Charlotte area. There will be no expansion of the list, for someone new to join, someone else must leave. This is the way.

So, here they are. **My top three cinnamon rolls spots in Charlotte**:  

1. 🥇 [**Honeybear Bake Shop**](https://www.honeybearbakeshop.com/): Stuff here
2. 🥈 [**Sunflour Baking Company**](https://sunflourbakingcompany.com/): 
3. 🥉 [**Morning Rolls**](#morning-rolls): 

And my honrable mention goes to **[NameHere]()**
