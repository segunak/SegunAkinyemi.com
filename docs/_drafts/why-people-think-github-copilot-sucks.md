Title: GitHub Copilot Doesn't Suck But People Think It Does and I Can Understand Why

Excertpt: (TBD but have hte word Claude Code in there somehwere and how it doesn't suck but I undersatnd why they think it does.

This thread is what motivated me to write this post.

https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1qed7mb/whats_actually_stopping_microsoft_from_making/ 
(screenshot hte post)

Disclaimer, I work at the company that owns GItHub, but I have nothing to do with GithIUb. Like, I'm comically far away from taht prodcut, and in the spirit of dogfooding (companies using their own products ot find the flows nad make it better) I have bene using GitHub copilot daily at work since it came out and uqite like it, to the point where I eventually in my personal devleopment left Cursor and Claude Code and use GitHub Copilot (which is an umbrella term, many products underneath that, more on that later) for my persona ldevleopment too and have found it not more than a half step behind Claude Code, and when using Agent Mode in VS Code, straigt up better htna Cursor, whic his literlaly just a fork of VS Code.

The entire premise of that post is untrue, literally every single thing they're saying GitHu bCopilot doesn't do it does , but I understand why the poster feels the way they do. They're not alone, this has been a sentiment for sime time, See this hacker news thread. 

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44802723 (screenshot the comment)

Simply put. GitHub Copilot used to suck. But, it doesn't suck anymore. I've used Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, Replit, Lovable, and of course GitHub Copilot, like I'm knee deep in the coding iwth AI world, and GitHUb Copilot is right there with all of htem ,better than most of them, with the exception of Claude Code being supeiror form a terminal standpoint right now, but GitHub COpilto CLI is maybe a half step or two behind ,it does not suck, it is not terirble, it si not trash, and the platitudes being thrown aroun do ntech ttwitter and reddit and hacker news reflect a community not intersted in facts and eason and more a reaction to Microsfot having quite a few public "souless corproatioN "moments from getting rid of their emplyoee libarrayr to dsstroyin gthe XBox brand to trying to add Recall feature to spy on os to Windos to adding ads to the windows start men to Microsoft Copilot, which isn't hte same as Copilot, being kind of trash as far as the general public is concered with the CEO even admitting it .

But all of that is the larger company Microsoft and their drama beign transmuted to GitHub Copilot and the IGtHUb team. THat's not fair. I mean, the only examle I can think of right now is blaming people from one state for stuff happening in another state when that other state has different lwamakers and govnerers and mayors nad literlaly different people. I don't live in that state .I don't know why that state did what the ydid, but yes, we are all in the same country, but now we're not all the same, nad no I don't appreciate you saying I suck becuase htat state way over there sucks.

(Mention the OpeNCode integration for GitHUb as an example of the GitHub team not sucking.)

GitHub Copilot Doesn't Suck.

It doesn't, but the launch of the product being little than fancy auto complete cemented in the minds of many in the develper community, mostly those working outside of enterprise sitatuons where they're tied to whatever AI coding service their employer signed up for and can't change that, that GitHub Copilot isn't really much more than that.

For what feels like a long time, as far as the world of AI developments go, GitHub Copilot did suck. It wasn't more than fancy autocomplete, and for the most part it felt like it was fighting you, trying to help yo uwrite code by interrputing your typing and make obnoxous suggesstions that sometimes were good and most itmes weren't. But all of that changed when GitHub releases agent mode for GItHub Copilit in VS Code (mention or hyperlink to this Hacker News thread about htat release https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42964327). That was the turning point where I personally think GithUB copilot firmly left the "lol this sucks dude Microslop they suc kblah blah I don't bother to use the stuff but I think I can tal kabout how much it sucks because it's convrieenet and makes me feel good" terriorty. I wrote about that launch after using it myself and realizing this is rather signifncant in terms of coding iwth AI.

And for those of you thinking "well Cursor already was doing that", can yo uguess what open source fork of an IDE Cursor is based on? VS Code, brought to you by Microsfot, owners of GitHub. You think you're an indie developer avoiding the big bad corporations ,but you're not. 

And for good measure, let me remind you that Microsoft has invested in Anthropic, uses and encoruaes use of Claude models within giThub Copilot (I literally work at Microsoft and have been in meetings with managers telling us use the best model to hel pyou be productive we don't care which one, and for the past year or so continuning onto that day that's been Sonnet 4.5 then Opus 4.1 and now Opus 4.5 ,I've been Claude only models for over a year working at mIcrosoft and I know plenty of others the same)

What I think is messing people up is

Like thi scomment 

It is. As someone that has been in the weeds of Hacker News threads and Reddit about this, what is happening is the developer community is not aware of how diverse the term "GitHub Copilot" is these days. The perception is still that it's just autocomplete when you're typing code. Take this comment, just a few months ago, for example.
 

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44802723 (screenshot this)

Nicrosoft isn't helping this, but they have:
 
GitHub Copilot in VS Code with Agent Mode (competes with Cursor and is just as good if not better)
GitHub Copilot CLI (competes with Claude Code and isn't as good but is getting there)
GitHub Copilot Spark, or GitHub Spark I guess (completes with Lovable and Replit, isn't better than either)
GitHub Copilot Agents in the Browser (https://github.com/copilot/agents, fully Agentic coding without leaving your browser, this is where the Agent HQ and "steering" feature where you can chat with the agent while it's working comes in).
And many more things with "GitHub Copilot" at the front then "Some Feature" afterwards. So the conversation online is muddied and most people popping off on Twitter and Reddit and Hacker News are comparing Apples to Oranges.
 
Furthermore, for a long time this extension as been around and its well thought of - Claude Code for VS Code - Visual Studio Marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code)
 
So the discourse is just muddied is all. GitHub Copilot doesn't suck, but the marketing/brand awareness/clarity for customers certainly does.

Mention at some point that people all over Reddit, Hacker News, and tech Twitter are comparing GitHub Copilot to every single coding tool out there, most oftentimes Claude Code, but they're not always talking about hte same thing because of hte confusion GitHub has created with the GitHUb Copilot brand ndame now representing many products

GitHub Copilot CLI that compemtes iwth Claude Code and OpenCode and OpenAI Codex and is right there with all of them and is rapidbyl getitng new features to where whatever you tried last month taht made yo usay "lol it sucks bro" they've liekly already fixed or added hthat feuatre .Follow https://x.com/_Evan_Boyle for the latest on that, he's the guy at Microsfot building the Github copilot CLI 

GitHub Copilto in VS Code's Agent mode, or plan mode, or ask mode, or edit mode, each of which behave direfferently and only Agent mode is a direct competior and to me flat out better than Cursor

Point to these threads comparing github copilot and claude code and how if it' smore than a month old whateve rsomeone is saying in the comments section is likely out of date. that's how fast the AI coding world is moving. And the comments like this

Mentio nthese threas where people are realizing what I'm basically saying in this entire blog post. GitHub Copilot is overhated and it's sort of their fault for launching it as "meh" auto complete but they've worked hard af since then and it' son par with all the other coding tools.

Talk about how people are having wildily different Github copilot experiences based on the model the ychoose .If you're on the basic plan and in Agent Modei n VS Code with Github Copilot (what moutful) using GPT-5-mini and then hopping onto Reddit, Twitter, or Hacker News to declaere "lol dude GitHub Copilot sucks Microslop lollol" then you're having a wildly different expreince to someone doing the smae thing but using Opus 4.5 and realizing "this is as goo if not better than Cursor" or someone using Opus 4.5 with the Github Copilot CLI and realizing "yeah this is a legit Cladue Code compeitor" 

https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1ptyb5k/which_is_the_best_version_of_copilot_for_coding/

I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that vibe coders have entered the discourse of coding iwth AI and many of them, to be candid, don't know what they're talking about. They are recationary, and are writing prompts like "make it prettiter" and then telling us which of these coding tools is the best one and all theo ther sucks based on wihc hone can besat take their nontechnical derivel and teurn it into something they can brag about onlie. Sorry if that's harsh. In fact, no. I'm not soryr. 

These are people I thin kworth following and respecting what they say when ti comes to the AI in coding world.

And it's funny, given Micrsoft's close releations and part ownership of OpenAI, how they seem to have hte same proble mof not being able to name their products clearly that Microsfot has had for decades. See htis tweet about coding from Simon Willison (and mention who he is and he's repsected)

https://x.com/simonw/status/1954533526369681877/?rw_tt_thread=True

I've writeen about this before when it comes to the terirble namin of the xbox

https://segunakinyemi.com/blog/natural-language-programming/#an-addendum-microsoft-cant-name-things

Microsoft is terrible at naming things. This thread on Reddit is another example that specifically metniosn Azure based products they keep renaming and confusing the entire world.

Mention that Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node JS and Deno said this 

https://x.com/rough__sea/status/2013280952370573666/

> This has been said a thousand times before, but allow me to add my own voice: the era of humans writing code is over. Disturbing for those of us who identify as SWEs, but no less true. That's not to say SWEs don't have work to do, but writing syntax directly is not it.

Recenetly and literalyl everyone on tech twitter worth listeining to is agreeing with him. My vocie is sinintaly less impactful but I agree as well, yo udon't need to write code by hand anymore nad doing so is feeling kind of arhcaic these days.

Eveidence of GitHub Copilot being used with OpenCode now

https://x.com/github/status/2011822451613712646/?rw_tt_thread=True

This comes o nthe heel of some news that leaked that Microsoft was rolling out Claude Code to emplyoees in a certian deviison

https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1q6rimw/even_microsoft_employees_started_using_claude_code/

Which, is true.  And now the same leaker is saying that rollout has paused.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1qgx6br/microsoft_pauses_claude_code_rollout_after_satya/

All I can sya is, as someone that's into using all of the AI coding tiools, I really would challenge anyone saying their exrience with Claude Code or Cursor or Codex or OpenCode or Replit or Lovable or Antigravity is signignintaly, and let me emphasize sinifnalty, meaning it's so much better that other things are literlaly trahs and unsable, than GitHub Copilot. every single one of those things does some stuff betteter tha nGithub Copilot 'm sure, but the reverse is also true. The github geam is o nfire recently with the stuff they'v eben adding.

Mention https://github.com/zoicware/RemoveWindowsAI

when talking about how Microsoft Copilot sucks nad all the other trangessions there. Mention tihs great tool

Also, this is a great tweet represnting how much Microsfot OCpilot Sucks in a poetic sort of storytelling way.

https://x.com/gothburz/status/1999124665801880032/?rw_tt_thread=True

Then this article abput Satya Nadella basically saying and it leakin that Microsfot Copilot sucks 

https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-copilot/ai-isnt-optional-at-microsoft-but-almost-no-one-is-using-copilot

----

Would be good to mention this Andrej Karpathy feeling like he's overwhlemed with all the AI coding stuff so I don't blame anyone who doesn't work at a company with a Github Copilot license being behind on the fat htat "oh GitHub Copilot used to just be fancy autocomplete but now it literlaly does all the tings that yo uthink are only possible with Claude Coe or Cursor or Antigravity or Codex or whatever, it does it all, GitHub Copilot is now an umbrella term"

Section About How Microsoft has confused vveryone using Copilot for everthing. Microsoft Copilot and GIthub Copilot

This thread is a real world example. I nresponse to this tweet by Dax, the founder nad developer behind OpenCode 

https://x.com/thdxr/status/2011792025599766784 

Simon Willson (include how he's a huge name in the AI coding space and who he is and that he's been quoted in Anthropic and Google article sand all overi n coding) teweeted this

https://x.com/simonw/status/2011862194439536657

The fact that he doesn't even know says a lot. Then paraphrase this chat I sent to a collage to try t oexplain things.

GitHub Copilot in VS Code with Agent Mode (competes with Cursor and is just as good if not better)
GitHub Copilot CLI (competes with Claude Code and isn't as good but is getting there)
GitHub Copilot Spark, or GitHub Spark I guess (completes with Lovable and Replit, isn't better than either)
GitHub Copilot Agents in the Browser (https://github.com/copilot/agents, fully Agentic coding without leaving your browser, this is where the Agent HQ and "steering" feature where you can chat with the agent while it's working comes in).
And many more things with "GitHub Copilot" at the front then "Some Feature" afterwards. So the conversation online is muddied and most people popping off on Twitter and Reddit and Hacker News are comparing Apples to Oranges.
