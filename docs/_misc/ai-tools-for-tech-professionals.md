## AI Tools for Tech Professionals

Let's talk about the AI tools that are catching on with tech professionals. I'm not just talking about chatbots—you've likely heard of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. Instead, I want to highlight tools that integrate directly into people's workflow, without breaking immersion (having to copy/paste stuff into a chat window all the time).

### AI Coding Tools

* [**GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat) - This is my daily driver. It enables natural language conversations about code within VS Code, helping with writing, debugging, and explaining code through dialog. With Microsoft owning both GitHub and VS Code, and having strong OpenAI ties, it provides access to cutting-edge AI models while staying in your IDE. It's model-agnostic too—you can use Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek and others.

* [**Gemini Code Assist**](https://codeassist.google/) - Google's AI coding assistant that integrates with IDEs to provide contextual code completions and suggestions based on your codebase and documentation.

* [**Amazon Q Developer**](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) - AWS's AI coding companion that assists with code generation, troubleshooting, and answering questions about AWS services and general programming tasks.

* [**Cursor**](https://www.cursor.com/) - An AI-powered code editor built on VS Code. While GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode will likely make this redundant soon, they pioneered many AI-IDE integration features.

### AI Development Platforms

* [**Vercel v0**](https://v0.dev/) - A generative UI system that converts plain text descriptions into React code. Great for React projects, especially those leveraging NextJS (also a Vercel product).

* [**Lovable.dev**](https://lovable.dev/) - A tool that enables creating functional websites through conversational prompts, making web development more accessible to those without extensive technical backgrounds.

* [**Replit GhostWriter**](https://replit.com/ghostwriter) - An AI coding assistant built into Replit, which is a browser-based coding platform where you can write and run code without installing anything locally. GhostWriter helps generate code, fix bugs, and explain concepts directly in your browser while you work on projects.

* [**GitHub Spark**](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark) - An AI-powered tool for creating and sharing micro apps ("sparks"), which can be tailored to your exact needs and preferences, and are directly usable from your desktop and mobile devices without needing to write or deploy any code.

### AI Design Assistants

* [**Canva Magic Design**](https://www.canva.com/magic-design/) - A feature in Canva that generates design layouts based on text descriptions, offering a starting point for visual assets for applications and presentations.

* [**Microsoft Designer**](https://designer.microsoft.com/) - A tool that converts text descriptions into visual designs, helping create graphics and layouts for various purposes without requiring advanced design skills.

* [**Adobe Firefly**](https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly.html) - Adobe's AI image generator that creates images from text descriptions and can edit existing images. It's designed to be used for commercial projects.

### AI Research and Documentation Tools

* [**NotebookLM**](https://notebooklm.google/) - A tool by Google that helps analyze and synthesize information from documents, useful for research and extracting insights from technical documentation.

* [**Perplexity AI**](https://www.perplexity.ai/) - An AI-powered search engine and research assistant that provides comprehensive answers with cited sources, helping users quickly gather information and insights from across the web without having to manually sort through multiple search results.

* [**Elicit**](https://elicit.org/) - An AI research assistant designed specifically for researchers, helping them search through academic papers, ask questions about research, and summarize findings.

* [**Scite.ai**](https://scite.ai/) - An AI-powered platform that helps researchers evaluate the credibility of scientific papers by analyzing how they've been cited by other research.

### Privacy-Focused AI Development Tools

* [**AnythingLLM**](https://anythingllm.com/) - An open-source locally hosted ChatGPT-like interface that enables private document analysis and question answering without sending your code or data to third parties.

* [**LM Studio**](https://lmstudio.ai/) - A desktop application that allows you to download and run open-source large language models locally on your computer, providing code assistance while keeping your data private.

* [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) - A lightweight framework for running large language models locally, supporting various models like Llama, Mistral, and Code Llama for private coding assistance.
